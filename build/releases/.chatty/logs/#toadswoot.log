[20:46:31] <@Hopeisnotlost> oh you dont go there in hundo too?
[20:46:40] <@Hopeisnotlost> isnt there a heart piece in the 2nd half of the dungeon
[20:47:02] <@Hopeisnotlost> oh
[20:47:25] <@Hopeisnotlost> this is why glitchless is the better category
[20:48:41] <@Hopeisnotlost> cant wait for glitchless to get into sgdq
[20:49:08] <@Hopeisnotlost> yea quo submitted it
[20:49:23] UNMOD: Sttaner93
[20:49:43] <@Hopeisnotlost> nope it's better than hundo
[20:49:58] <@%Karrecod> It's refreshing to see all the things we normally skip
[20:50:22] <@%Karrecod> I forgot so many caves and stuff even existed
[20:50:23] <@Hopeisnotlost> hundo has more stuff thats bad
[20:50:59] <@Hopeisnotlost> and its too long (for me)
[20:51:21] UNMOD: tecul1
