[23:45:07] <%ultrabeep> wailord and seedot can breed

[23:46:25] <Technetium43> male skitty and female wailord. it would have to be artificial insemination either way, but for the female wailord you would basically have to fucking CLIMB IN THERE to actually inseminate. There's your lovely mental image for the day

[23:32:40] <Aaron0000> Or Araquanid
[23:32:49] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Noivern is the flip side of that
[23:32:51] <Aaron0000> Wishiwashi is a bro for a casual playthrough
[23:32:58] <kidumbra> >castform
[23:32:59] <@%VulshokSorcerer> fast as fuck, but not particularly strong
[23:33:04] <@%VulshokSorcerer> it's got boomburst though
[23:33:05] <IschmarVI> and then, everything reasonable with more than like 70 base speed has max EV in speed, LUL
[23:33:06] <@%KirbymastaH> keizaWut
[23:33:08] <Aaron0000> Eats most of the game up for breakfast
[23:33:11] <+sirkrustyy> I guess lycanroc is fast?
[23:33:14] <kidumbra> he infiltrated team Aqua DansGame
[23:33:29] <@%VulshokSorcerer> lycanroc is the exception that proves the rule
[23:33:29] <IschmarVI> and that means you won't outspeed it anyway unless you are a friggin +1 ninjask or something

[23:35:09] <kidumbra> Gen 3 non-remakes had such good music but the sprites did not age well
[23:35:17] <Aaron0000> Yo dawg we heard you like eggs, so we put an egg in yo egg
[23:35:31] <IschmarVI> level 70 kakuna Kreygasm
[23:35:32] UNMOD: Littlesquare
[23:35:54] <kidumbra> put an egg in your egg so your game can crash while it crudbfoahdgridhfcjdj
[23:36:33] <IschmarVI> but gen 3 has the french horns of destiny Kreygasm
[23:36:41] <Mefistofelessss> damn, i'm late
[23:36:54] <Aaron0000> Trying to make a new 'mons-only team in gen 7 was hell due to 90% of things being slow.
[23:37:04] <IschmarVI> ribombee
[23:37:05] <IschmarVI> is all you need
[23:37:39] <Aaron0000> Ended up with Inciniroar, Alo-Chu, Alo-Tales, WIshiwashi, Dhemise, and Kommo-O
[23:37:43] <IschmarVI> and besides that, being slow is not that bad in gen 7 as it is in other ones.
[23:37:50] <Mefistofelessss> @IschmarVI and this gen was the first to have a unique gen 4 theme, which FUCKING ROCKS
[23:38:05] <lurkerSM> dhelmise is so weird
[23:38:06] <IschmarVI> because in "boss" fights, the fast opponents will outspeed you no matter what, so being bulky is actually useful
[23:38:42] <Aaron0000> Love how 80% of my totem fights constsed of me nuking the shit out of the totem with a Z-Move LUL
[23:38:46] <IschmarVI> exceptions are mons that are as ridiculously fast as ribombee
[23:38:48] <Aaron0000> *consisted
[23:39:04] <@%VulshokSorcerer> my new mons team was great in gen 7
[23:39:14] <lurkerSM> i lost against salazzle twice and leavanny once in my first run
[23:39:16] <lurkerSM> feels bad
[23:39:26] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Mudsdale, Lycanroc, Ribombee, the starter
[23:39:30] <IschmarVI> I mean, that thing outspeeds Noivern. Nuff said Kappa
[23:39:47] <+sirkrustyy> There is not a single gen 7 pokemon in my gen 7 team zMistake
[23:39:52] <@%VulshokSorcerer> can't remember my other two, but I think one was Alolan Ninetales (which half counts)
[23:39:57] <Aaron0000> WIshiwashi ate Salazzle for breakfast and her kids for hor d'eurves.
[23:40:20] <@%VulshokSorcerer> oh, I had Salazzle
[23:40:34] <Aaron0000> >That feeling when trying to hatch a shiny female salandit
[23:40:37] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Salazze was the first time I ever had poison in a core team poke since gen1
[23:40:55] <kidumbra> I always thought hideouts remained open after the whole legendary thing in emera
[23:40:58] <kidumbra> eme2era
[23:41:01] <kidumbra> emera
[23:41:07] <IschmarVI> @Aaron0000 almost as fun as hatching a female shiny eevee Kappa
[23:41:11] <Varying> what did youy have in gen 1
[23:41:18] <kidumbra> FUCKING FAT FINGERS FUCK
[23:41:23] <IschmarVI> with its eight thousand something steps
[23:41:26] <Varying> lol
[23:41:28] <@%VulshokSorcerer> venu in my first run, but was mostly talking about Nido
[23:41:42] <Varying> ah
[23:41:42] <kidumbra> ohhh ok
[23:41:54] <Aaron0000> Nidoking was literally gojira
[23:42:01] <IschmarVI> nidoking was literally > god
[23:42:03] <Varying> LUL
[23:42:07] <IschmarVI> because it could just horn drill god Kappa
[23:42:14] <Aaron0000> Although half the things in that game were kaiju
[23:42:18] <Mefistofelessss> Now I want to play a randomized nuzlock challenge of emerald

[23:42:23] <Aaron0000> Learning flame/bolt/beam

[23:42:53] <IschmarVI> STAB body slam is sooo fast Kreygasm
[23:43:02] <Aaron0000> Still amazes me that Rhydon can Surf for some reason.
[23:43:04] <+Gedrith> Good, How are you bud?
[23:43:05] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Bolt/beam, EQ, and either Fire/Water for coverage or a strong normal move

[00:04:41] <@%VulshokSorcerer> event pokes like that shouldn't count against normal spawn locations
[00:04:49] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but somethign could be only there and rock smash or something

[00:35:34] <Aaron0000> Base 140 in everything except HP and has Protean
[00:35:51] <Mefistofelessss> Mega arceus will happen when the gen 4 remakes are released
[00:35:51] <%Zerkiiee> He'd recreate the universe and make it so that your Pokemon fainted before it sent out of its Pokèball
[00:36:11] <Mefistofelessss> Nah, it will have a unique ability for sure
[00:36:21] <kidumbra> LUL
[00:36:23] <%Zerkiiee> Like screw reversing time, he'd just recreate everything
[00:36:26] <Aaron0000> Welp, good ol Game Freak only uses a gimmick per gen.
[00:36:27] <Mefistofelessss> And a unique move, at least one
[00:36:32] <Aaron0000> So Megas are locked away forever.
[00:36:35] <%Zerkiiee> Yep
[00:36:51] <Mefistofelessss> Highly doubt they will never make any new mega, they are too game changing
[00:36:52] <kidumbra> Gen 7 says hi aurThink
[00:36:56] <Aaron0000> We'll never see following Pokemon again.

[00:45:38] <kidumbra> Absol is bro, Gen 4 made it better tho

[01:12:01] <SSRchuck> Damn bro
[01:12:04] <Viperisk> hey keiz and chat
[01:12:26] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> Did they say why they went through the abdomen instead of, er, a more direct method?

[01:12:35] <SSRchuck> You’re a champ bro. Seriously. 🙏🏼
[01:12:53] <Viperisk> @Stupid_Pokenerd its also so the ball doesnt drain into the body
[01:13:13] <AlfimieChan> visuals man lool
[01:13:23] <Clyph> Does having one less testicle drastically reduce your chanced to produce children? I'm sure theres an impact but like is it bad?

[01:19:26] <mike4970> 😂
[01:19:28] <Clyph> @Mefistofelessss i think theres phantom pain for most body parts that can be removed
[01:19:30] <%Zerkiiee> Pomeg glitch is insane.
[01:19:34] <Viperisk> Phantom pain is where the body is looking for the missing part...and since it cant find it...it produces pain
[01:19:43] <Mefistofelessss> Metal Gear VI: crotch phantom pain
[01:19:55] <azuthal> got something worth a damn thanks for the luck

[01:20:56] <Viperisk> everyone is different. You may not get any lol
[01:20:58] <AlfimieChan> yep same
[01:21:29] <Varying> anything on the surface is so skin cancer too
[01:21:38] <%STEELFROST_> So did getting the cancer affect what you were able to eat?\
[01:21:41] <Clyph> being relatively easy to spot early probably helps the survivability a lot
[01:21:47] <Viperisk> ^
[01:21:49] <Varying> stuff below the surface is tougher
[01:21:57] <%STEELFROST_> well thats not too bad then

[01:22:18] <Mefistofelessss> Yeah I imagine tumors in the balls are easy to notice. As opposed to tumors in the lungs and intesting, like my father had and has
[01:22:20] <%Esperinforce> We can still blame that Pineapple Pizza
[01:22:22] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but that's because he found out he's allergic, not the cancer
[01:22:30] <Viperisk> like keiz...mine was caught early. so it was just surgery and I'm good

[01:31:43] <@%Sly_Envy> @eulecsgo keizaHey
[01:31:43] <Mefistofelessss> Nah, Slowpoke is canonically dumb. Slowking is the smart one.
[01:31:44] <AlfimieChan> and slowking is the mastering of that ability or wut
[01:31:46] <%FlareyPwns2> sounds like a great creepy pasta
[01:31:47] <%+sgrunt> sly keizaNeat ™
[01:31:49] <%eulecsgo> Sly KeizaHey
[01:31:55] <%eulecsgo> keizaHey
[01:31:55] <%$Red_Wavve> what's the poke that's being found everywhere this rom?
[01:31:56] <%eulecsgo> damn
[01:31:59] <AlfimieChan> technically alakazam is like smart as a super computer or some shit
[01:32:01] <@%Sly_Envy> keizaNeat

[01:32:09] <%whit_send> "I could use pants" - Slowking
[01:32:11] <@%VulshokSorcerer> not a single poke Red, but everything has Sweet Kiss

[01:32:16] <%$Red_Wavve> oh
[01:32:21] <%$Red_Wavve> so sweet kiss is the majority this time
[01:32:24] <Mefistofelessss> @AlfimieChan the pokedex says alakazam has 900IQ or some retarded impossible shit like that
[01:32:26] <%whit_send> hi Sly
[01:32:29] <Clyph> ITS VAPE GOD
[01:32:29] <%$Red_Wavve> hello rest of chat btw
[01:32:45] <@%VulshokSorcerer> it was annoying earlier, cuz it took a while to find sweet scent
[01:32:47] <AlfimieChan> @Mefistofelessss Yeh if he was that smart he wouldnt let himself get caught
[01:32:53] <@%VulshokSorcerer> though it was on Articuno again
[01:32:57] <%$Red_Wavve> what time did you start the ROM at, keiz?
[01:33:02] <Mefistofelessss> @AlfimieChan they would have their own civilization
[01:33:08] <Varying> 900IQ - ca only say its name
[01:33:10] <Mefistofelessss> For umbreon, just wait till night Kappa
[01:33:12] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> If it was smart, it'd be able to learn more than 4 moves
[01:33:14] <Varying> can*
[01:33:18] <%$Red_Wavve> like what IGT
[01:33:20] <%$Red_Wavve> that's what I mean
[01:33:21] <AlfimieChan> @Mefistofelessss And he'd probably not voluntarily eat shadow balls and die.
[01:33:24] <@%Sly_Envy> hey pokenerd keizaHey
[01:33:31] <Yipne> Alakzam is in command of his trainer: he's just in an eternal tsukoyomi
[01:33:33] <AlfimieChan> !lost shadow balls
[01:33:34] <@%BotGotsThis> Well, me losing one shadow balls actually evens out the playing field.
[01:33:35] <Clyph> Alakazam probably realizes that there are more humans than Alakazams and that rebellling would be a lost cause
[01:33:40] <Varying> 900IQ - lower vocab than meoth
[01:33:40] <Mefistofelessss> @Stupid_Pokenerd he can learn more than 4. Just can't remember more than that at the same time.
[01:33:41] <HealingMind> He's under Human command because he knows if his spoons will consume him if he unleashes his power Kappa
[01:33:51] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> Hey Sly
[01:33:57] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> And you know what I meant
[01:34:07] <%$Red_Wavve> You have Eevee info, right? You could always go for Umbreon via evolution

[01:42:21] <@%altabiscuit> at limit break
[01:42:39] <%whit_send> Yeah, idk about lag or input delay or anything with it, since I don't really speedrun the games I play on it
[01:42:55] <Xorit> I've not experienced any lag tbh
[01:43:01] <%whit_send> And even if I did, I'd be playing on an HD TV which already has some lag, so idk

I hate this idea that you’re the best. I’m the best. But There’s one thing you’re better at than I am and that’s kissing Exarion's ass.
[02:01:29] <+Gedrith> you dont know me

[02:06:49] <RoyaalC> He's living with Gunner? :O
[02:06:49] <%Zerkiiee> I think it's Gunner personally
[02:06:51] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> So, what you're say is... Gunner's a bad influence
[02:06:52] <Globalgamer> yeah
[02:07:02] <+zapdos23590> GunnerIsAFraud GunnerIsAFraud GunnerIsAFraud
[02:07:02] <@%BotGotsThis> GunnerIsAFraud is a fraud
[02:07:03] <%Zerkiiee> I've seen him before an after and Gunner is just... he's got this negative personality.
[02:07:03] <+landoleans> Cause gunner is a hermit
[02:07:05] <+sirkrustyy> I legit can't watch gunners stream. Even though he is a great runner I can
[02:07:15] <%+Gedrith> so Keiz, when you coming to visit me?
[02:07:16] <+sirkrustyy> t keep up with all the weeb stuff
[02:07:21] <%Zerkiiee> Same
[02:07:27] <%Zerkiiee> Personally it's not the weeb stuff
[02:07:29] <Globalgamer> Gunner is usually pretty chill, other than being an anime addict
[02:07:29] <@%BotGotsThis> Gunner is a OSFrog
[02:07:31] <%Zerkiiee> It's the constant sex talk
[02:07:32] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> Just remember: keizaBan
[02:07:41] <%Zerkiiee> It's like a Virgin chat in there
[02:07:41] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> ...Fuck, forgot my gifted sub ran out
[02:07:42] <%+Gedrith> no one wants to come here :(
[02:07:47] <%Zerkiiee> As a person he's fine
[02:08:19] <%Zerkiiee> His streams and personality sometimes just gets really bad...
[02:08:34] <%Zerkiiee> Yeah...
[02:08:39] <PurplePirate_> i watch gunner and his new mic is a huge upgrade
[02:08:52] <%Zerkiiee> The questions get way too personal
[02:09:02] <%Zerkiiee> They're baiting him into spilling stuff
[02:09:09] <hyrule1989> A chat experience can only be a certain way if the streamer and the mods enforce it.
[02:09:10] <+Risotis> PogChamp the godkarp
[02:09:16] <+zapdos23590> I have that problem with Lucky, I wanna watch him, but his stream quality is usually really lousy muhFeels
[02:09:18] <+sirkrustyy> yeti afaik
[02:09:19] <MattMasters22> Kek called it
[02:09:27] <%Esperinforce> !luckypls
[02:09:32] <+sirkrustyy> blue yeti or watever its called
[02:09:39] <%Zerkiiee> There needs to be guidelines
[02:10:01] <+sirkrustyy> not 100% sure though so dont quote me
[02:10:16] <%$Red_Wavve> his old mic sounded like a boom mic iirc
[02:10:20] <%Zerkiiee> The issue is I'd watch his streams because he really is a good speedrunner and it is good to watch him do runs, at the GDQs without the chat is the prime way to watch him I feel.
[02:10:32] <Globalgamer> it's gotten a lot more anime heavy the past few times I've tried to watch...like WAY more, and it's impossible to watch because I can't relate
[02:10:35] <+Risotis> SourPls
[02:10:44] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> Wow
[02:10:46] <Globalgamer> as for other stuff I don't know
[02:10:47] <+sirkrustyy> even if you can relate its terrible
[02:10:51] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> thats even more screwed up why magma isnt winning
[02:10:55] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> their enemy's leader IS A PANSY
[02:10:57] <PurplePirate_> i think he said his mic cost $400, i'm not sure about the model
[02:10:59] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> AND THEY'RE STILL LOSING
[02:11:00] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> keizaLUL
[02:11:13] <Mefistofelessss> A ratata and a sentry LUL
[02:11:17] <+sirkrustyy> Because its legit nonstop anime and it just gets annoying
[02:11:20] <%$Senerio> Flip Gordon was almost all in today I as nervous
[02:11:25] <%Zerkiiee> Also @Globalgamer I agree, I enjoy my anime from time to time but by god people keep going on about "waifu x" or "date advice" non-stop
[02:11:38] <%Zerkiiee> Hence why I don't watch his streams.
[02:11:50] <%$Red_Wavve> Gunner's seemed to just approach his stream as "more viewers are better"
[02:11:55] <%$Red_Wavve> Which is whatever
[02:11:56] <+Risotis> LuL weebs complaining about being single in 2k18
[02:12:00] <ジェーり (gerry1888ofyt)> !who
[02:12:00] <@%BotGotsThis> WHO ARE YOU?!? keizaWho keizaWho keizaWho
[02:12:09] <Varying> LUL
[02:12:09] <Clyph> Im new here so pardon the dumb question, does keiz actually hate anime or is it just a meme
[02:12:16] <%Zerkiiee> And it's not that the actual topic of sex is uncomfortable, it's the "date advice" sstuff that is just so uncomfortable. Like I don't need to know about your date/sex life just shut up about it.
[02:12:26] <%Zerkiiee> I know
[02:12:30] <Mefistofelessss> Keiz himself is anime
[02:12:38] <%Zerkiiee> But it's funny for that reason
[02:12:41] <%whit_send> keizaCaricature
[02:12:41] <%+kzdouglas135> 'some'
[02:12:48] <+Risotis> Keizaron is my favorite anime SeemsGood
[02:12:50] <%donjuan_> that's because anime was a mistake
[02:12:52] <%$Hiraruda> As everyone knows, Keiz's favourite anime character is Hulk Hogan.
[02:12:54] <Mefistofelessss> Exactly!
[02:12:56] <%$Red_Wavve> keizaCulture when
[02:13:06] <%$Red_Wavve> idk what it'd look like just seems like a good emote name
[02:13:08] <Clyph> ah i gotcha, i dont really watch anime either. All i watch is boruto because i watched naruto as a kid LUL
[02:13:14] <%$Senerio> I enjoy supporting either Anime or Banime depending on how the mood strikes
[02:13:18] <%Zerkiiee> I've been watching err...
[02:13:22] <%donjuan_> keizaBan keizaBan
[02:13:28] <@%Sly_Envy> hi keiz
[02:13:32] <Mefistofelessss> @Clyph I like mexican food too
[02:13:39] <%$Red_Wavve> I watch anime a bit, but I enjoy memeing about banning it Keepo
[02:13:45] <%Zerkiiee> Megalobox. It's a decent boxing anime.
[02:13:51] <%Zerkiiee> But it's not entirely boxing
[02:13:54] <Clyph> Burrito, Salad, and Miso Soup are the best ninja team Kappa
[02:13:55] <%Zerkiiee> Exactly
[02:14:04] <%Zerkiiee> I couldn't watch something like the generic High School anime
[02:14:04] <%$Red_Wavve> I have a really similar approach with music in general
[02:14:11] <%Zerkiiee> Angel Beats is so god damn good
[02:14:14] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Angel Beats is great
[02:14:19] <hyrule1989> Angel Beats was supposed to get 24 eps
[02:14:21] <%Zerkiiee> It's got a great narrative
[02:14:22] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and the OP is top tier
[02:14:26] <hyrule1989> so it's no surprise you thought it needed more
[02:14:31] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but yeah, you can tell they cut some things short
[02:14:33] <Yipne> If you liked Angel Beats, then watch Zetsuen no Tempest; the feels are just as real
[02:14:35] <Mefistofelessss> What was the plot?
[02:14:47] <@%Sly_Envy> hows keiz?
[02:15:05] <%Zerkiiee> Describe it
[02:15:08] <%$Hiraruda> Did you ever check out Steins;Gate? It's a cult classic of a series and it's pretty short too.

[02:15:55] <Yipne> Isn't Pokémon our favourite anime ;-; ?

[02:16:10] <Gpro_> We didn't even know what anime was when Toonami was in its prime
[02:16:11] <Clyph> Avatar the Last Airbender is the best anime Kappa

[02:16:25] <+Risotis> Toonami PogChamp dragonball z
[02:16:28] <%Zerkiiee> But it's not something you go out of your way to watch.
[02:16:40] <%Zerkiiee> Yeah
[02:16:57] <%eulecsgo> Cowboy Bebop keizaGasm that intro music was so neat
[02:17:02] <+zapdos23590> Most of those were aimed at kids anyway, so they should count
[02:17:05] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Tenchi was such a weird show in retrospect
[02:17:27] <+Risotis> Cowboy Bebop aged really well
[02:17:27] <Clyph> There is no anime in Ba Sing Se
[02:17:28] <+sirkrustyy> I watch all initial d season once a year. Part of it is the drift memes though
[02:17:36] <%Zerkiiee> Megalobox has the same aesthetic and it's designed to look that way too.
[02:17:38] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Cowboy Bebop is also like 98% aesthetic
[02:18:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Ronin Warriors was pretty interesting
[02:18:06] <%Zerkiiee> Made in Abyss, I watched that anime
[02:18:07] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but that's quite a callback
[02:18:07] <%Zerkiiee> Zoids
[02:18:08] <%$Red_Wavve> I like all the weird fantasy anime
[02:18:09] <%Zerkiiee> Fuck yes.
[02:18:09] <%$Senerio> My favorite anime that isn't Shinesman is Samurai PIzza Cats
[02:18:13] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Zoids was great
[02:18:17] <+zapdos23590> I wanna watch Zoids again, I feel I didn't follow the plot at all

[02:18:31] <%Zerkiiee> I had watched Digimon and Pokemon but I wouldn't know if I could call it an anime, it's the same as Dragon Ball Z

[02:21:29] <%Zerkiiee> It's an adventure anime but I really don't want to spoil it
[02:21:32] <@%VulshokSorcerer> you're talking about Ryoko, which is all most people remember
[02:21:37] <%Zerkiiee> The show is just... so great.
[02:22:00] <Clyph> Code lyoko is best anime Keepo
[02:22:03] <+zapdos23590> Sasami was always my favorite though muhBlush
[02:22:05] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I have yet to find anyone else who's ever seen Ef
[02:22:11] <@%VulshokSorcerer> which is too bad, cuz it's a great show
[02:22:12] <%Esperinforce> keizaBan
[02:22:14] <BlueBisharp28> th as nice
[02:22:15] <%$Senerio> She heard the discussion going n
[02:22:16] <+Risotis> LUL this is now an anime stream]
[02:22:19] <@%Sly_Envy> i worked 8 hrs today vul
[02:22:21] <%$LilyWight> what is Ef?
[02:22:29] <@%Sly_Envy> hi lily
[02:22:32] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Ef: A Tale of Memories
[02:22:33] <%$LilyWight> Hello Sly
[02:22:39] <%Dakitteh> I think it's a psychotic pink haired alien girl?
[02:22:46] <@%Sly_Envy> hey kitteh
[02:22:46] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and Ef: A Tale of Melodies, which is season 2
[02:22:51] <%Zerkiiee> I tried to watch Bleach
[02:23:01] <+Risotis> There can only be 1 king SwiftRage
[02:23:11] <%Zerkiiee> Can't stand anything past the first arc
[02:23:17] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I was told I would probably enjoy Clannad, since I liked Angel Beats and Ef, but I've never gotten a chance to watch it
[02:23:21] <+Risotis> LuL
[02:23:22] <%Zerkiiee> Elfen Lied
[02:23:28] <+sirkrustyy> its such a fuckfest
[02:23:32] <%Zerkiiee> I tried watching it and it's like "What, people fucking like this shit?!"
[02:23:33] <+zapdos23590> Hard pass on Elfen Lied
[02:23:40] <Varying> slowwwking was in the mechanical island ep LUL
[02:23:41] <%Dakitteh> ah elfien lied was the psycho pink haired girl
[02:23:43] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Elfen Lied was real popular for a while, and I never got why
[02:23:48] <Yipne> Clannad is longwinded though, much unnessecary filler
[02:23:51] <+sirkrustyy> because gore
[02:23:53] <+sirkrustyy> thats it
[02:23:56] <%Zerkiiee> Because Gore
[02:23:57] <Varying> or wwas it slowbro
[02:23:57] <%Zerkiiee> Oh!
[02:23:59] <%$Hiraruda> Elfen Lied is garbo.
[02:24:01] <Varying> idkk
[02:24:03] <%Zerkiiee> Parasyte is a really good show
[02:24:15] <%$Red_Wavve> Parasyte is REALLY good
[02:24:24] UNMOD: Stringflow
[02:24:28] <%$Red_Wavve> It drags in the middle admittedly but it's still very good
[02:24:29] <+Risotis> s h u c k l e
[02:24:29] <%Dakitteh> after story was indeed better
[02:24:33] <%STEELFROST_> Dont give a shuckle bout nobody
[02:24:34] <%Zerkiiee> I don't watch a lot of anime but I like to get away from the very childish stuff
[02:24:37] <@%$Myzlstyx> myzlstHey
[02:24:42] <%$Red_Wavve> Hey Myzl
[02:24:46] <+Risotis> LUL
[02:24:47] <%Zerkiiee> Mostly because a lot of it is just lame
[02:24:49] <%$LilyWight> keizaWut
[02:24:53] <%Esperinforce> keizaLUL
[02:25:00] <+Risotis> BURNED
[02:25:04] <%$Senerio> the only anime I'm keeping current on is a kids anime; the Layton one
[02:25:10] <%Dakitteh> keizaBan
[02:25:11] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I really like to recommend Ef to people, but it's definitely got a lot of feels
[02:25:28] <@%altabiscuit> I can't wait to reenact this scene at RPGLB with plushes
[02:25:34] <+sirkrustyy> this fight seems so unfair
[02:25:35] <%+Mothump> Same here
[02:25:38] <+sirkrustyy> that tiny bit of land
[02:25:44] <%Zerkiiee> I don't go out of my way to watch an anime
[02:25:48] <%Zerkiiee> I let it just come to me
[02:25:51] <+Risotis> LuL
[02:25:55] <@%$Myzlstyx> Myzl is actually napping, I'm his best friend watching your stream because im bored.
[02:26:03] <%$Red_Wavve> oh really
[02:26:06] <%$Red_Wavve> LUL
[02:26:08] <StarStalker__> SourPls
[02:26:08] <+zapdos23590> I have a ton of anime I'm interested but streams and video games take too huge of a prioritry
[02:26:10] <%Technetium43> at least it doesn't use the terrifying drought music
[02:26:10] <+Risotis> account sharing, banned Kappa
[02:26:14] <%$Red_Wavve> ^^
[02:26:18] <%Dakitteh> see if it was little brother MAYBE I would believe you
[02:26:20] <TITOthereal> no game no life
[02:26:22] <%Technetium43> that sounds like some gen 1 lavender town copypasta music
[02:26:24] <%Zerkiiee> No Game No Life
[02:26:26] <+zapdos23590> No Game No Life looks amazing
[02:26:27] <%Zerkiiee> That is pretty good
[02:26:27] <@%VulshokSorcerer> No Game No Life
[02:26:29] <Mefistofelessss> @Myzlstyx post embarrassing secrets about him
[02:26:34] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I need to watch that still
[02:26:35] <%$Red_Wavve> No Game No Life first season was good, haven't seen the movie
[02:26:35] <%Zerkiiee> It's a nice gambling anime
[02:26:36] <@%VulshokSorcerer> heard good things
[02:26:39] <@%$Myzlstyx> lmao no
[02:26:44] <%Dakitteh> the movie is even worse keiz
[02:26:44] <%Zerkiiee> Yeah... the Incest tones are fucking weird
[02:26:45] <+Risotis> WHats wrong with incestuous tones Kappa
[02:26:45] <@%VulshokSorcerer> oh, uhhhh
[02:26:48] <Mefistofelessss> ...incestuous tones?
[02:26:49] <+zapdos23590> Log Horizon is one I recently watched that I loved
[02:26:50] <@%VulshokSorcerer> maybe give it a pass
[02:26:51] <%Zerkiiee> but I think they are meant to be weird, they're both NEETs
[02:26:52] <%$Red_Wavve> and yeah the incest tones e.e
[02:27:00] <@%VulshokSorcerer> got enough of that from The Irregular at Magic High School
[02:27:06] <%$LilyWight> keizaWut
[02:27:08] <Globalgamer> keizaWut
[02:27:10] <Varying> DansGame
[02:27:10] <@%VulshokSorcerer> which was a really cool show otherwise
[02:27:11] <+sirkrustyy> meanwhile gunner has oreimo in his best list
[02:27:17] <%$Senerio> gross
[02:27:20] <%Zerkiiee> It's just a good world
[02:27:24] <%Zerkiiee> Of course
[02:27:29] <%Zerkiiee> But it was how he got there
[02:27:32] <+Risotis> Ready Play One: the Anime Kappa
[02:27:36] <+Risotis> Player*
[02:27:41] <Clyph> your sister likes whatching an anime with incestuous tones jparaEw
[02:27:52] <%$LilyWight> I like the "how" more than the "if" in most situations
[02:27:59] <%$LilyWight> Especially if it's really well done
[02:28:20] <%whit_send> Liar Game?
[02:28:24] <%Zerkiiee> !fraud
[02:28:24] <@%BotGotsThis> Did you mean Gunnermaniac3?
[02:28:28] <Yipne> Boku no Politoed is a good anime too
[02:28:30] <Mefistofelessss> So you wouldn't enjoy a freudian show, uh?
[02:28:43] Viewerstats (02:00-02:28): avg:222 min:213 max:230 [15/220+5-1-2-5-3-1+9+7-12+9-3+5+1+1]
[02:28:44] <%$Senerio> I got super into Liar game, and then the author took a hiatus and never got back into it
[02:28:48] <%$LilyWight> The most recent anime I watched was Digimon Adventure Tri (sequel to first series), and man that was a bit of a mess in the second half
[02:28:59] <%whit_send> Yeah, it suffered a lot from sudden hiatus swordSad
[02:29:04] <%whit_send> But it's a really good manga/anime
[02:29:06] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> gunner???
[02:29:08] <%Zerkiiee> That scene where They're separated by a single door and start shaking, like okay I get it they're NEETs but then the woman opens the door and they just... it gets weirdddd
[02:29:10] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Digimon Tamers was the good digimon show
[02:29:11] <%$LilyWight> But I still liked it since I'm stupid big into Digimon
[02:29:15] <%$LilyWight> keizaBan
[02:29:20] <%$Senerio> Madoka is weird.
[02:29:21] <%Zerkiiee> Digimon Tri I watched and enjoyed but the second half was rushed...
[02:29:34] <Varying> FBtouchdown
[02:29:36] <%$LilyWight> yeah
[02:29:48] <%$LilyWight> 4th movie was trash
[02:29:56] <%Zerkiiee> 4th was the worst
[02:30:06] <%$LilyWight> 6th was alright, but a let down in the second half
[02:30:08] <%Zerkiiee> Also Omegamons new form is just the stupidest thing
[02:30:13] <%$LilyWight> yeah
[02:30:15] <%STEELFROST_> match up
[02:30:20] <%Zerkiiee> It looks awesome but... urg
[02:30:27] <%$LilyWight> again I agree
[02:30:33] <@%VulshokSorcerer> the whole power creep thing was why I preferred Tamers, and then didn't really follow after that
[02:30:36] <%Zerkiiee> "Meicoomon became the backup for all digimon's memories" was like what
[02:30:39] <%Esperinforce> keizaWut
[02:30:40] <@%VulshokSorcerer> because it did it in different ways
[02:30:43] <I4enigma> REEEE DansGame
[02:30:51] <%Zerkiiee> I mean they hinted at something bbecause she still had her memories but come on
[02:30:54] <%Zerkiiee> Oh it does
[02:30:56] <@%VulshokSorcerer> with the cards first, and then the merging with the digimon later on
[02:31:08] <%Technetium43> !allthehits doubleslap
[02:31:08] <Mefistofelessss> More like quintuple slap
[02:31:08] <@%BotGotsThis> Dear Diary, today I was hit by doubleslap FIVE TIMES.
[02:31:11] <@%VulshokSorcerer> !allthehits Doubleslap
[02:31:11] <@%BotGotsThis> Dear Diary, today I was hit by Doubleslap FIVE TIMES.
[02:31:15] <%Zerkiiee> But that was natural progression
[02:31:17] <%$Senerio> My favorite anime is Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE
[02:31:21] <%Zerkiiee> And was reflected with their bond.
[02:31:22] <%$Senerio> When's #AW
[02:31:23] <+zapdos23590> I love Digimon Tamers, it was so good
[02:31:24] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I still want to play TMS
[02:31:27] <%STEELFROST_> cuz two hits? o-o
[02:31:29] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but I don't have a WiiU
[02:31:32] <@%VulshokSorcerer> needs a switch port
[02:31:34] <Mefistofelessss> Its a multiple double slap, it technically hit you 10 times
[02:31:34] <%Zerkiiee> You want Power Creep take a look at Season 4, that has it BAD
[02:31:36] <%$Senerio> TMS is so good
[02:31:36] <Timmipotop> Round Trip Slap, so kinda multi slap
[02:31:37] <%$LilyWight> I need to continue TMS
[02:31:43] <Clyph> tf is with noctowls eyes
[02:31:49] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Digimon Season 4 did some dumb stuff
[02:31:50] <+zapdos23590> Digimon Season 4 was extremely muhUgh
[02:31:52] <%Zerkiiee> It's like "oh we need a new form" there is this prophecy that you can do!
[02:31:58] <PurplePirate_> btw, isn't splash really jump?
[02:31:58] <@%VulshokSorcerer> starting by not having digimon partners
[02:32:04] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and having them transform instead
[02:32:08] <%Zerkiiee> No, I like the concept big time
[02:32:16] <+zapdos23590> I hate the concept
[02:32:18] <%Technetium43> BIG FLUFF
[02:32:19] <%Zerkiiee> It's one of the darkest seasons
[02:32:25] <%$Senerio> Oh wait the demo of that Pokemon Fantame I wanted to make fun of came out yesterday
[02:32:26] <$Pkmanta> I always forget digimon exists
[02:32:28] <%Zerkiiee> They're literally in the digital world as its falling apart
[02:32:30] <%$Senerio> Gonna play that
[02:32:31] <@%VulshokSorcerer> have you seen the end of Tamers Zerk?
[02:32:33] <Mefistofelessss> Altaria looks so hugg-able. So fluffy
[02:32:40] <%Zerkiiee> Yeah
[02:32:42] <@%VulshokSorcerer> dark is like it's middle and last names
[02:32:42] <+zapdos23590> YYa, end of Tamers was messed up
[02:32:46] <Clyph> i had a shiny altaria. I had a friend that stole it. FeelsBadMan
[02:32:46] <%Zerkiiee> Season 3 is just... FeelsBadMan

[02:33:04] <PurplePirate_> @Clyph are you still friends?
[02:33:07] <%Zerkiiee> Anything after that is just weird
[02:33:10] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I liked Tamers, cuz it didn't shy way from things, even as a "kids" show
[02:33:15] <%Esperinforce> !moo
[02:33:15] <@%BotGotsThis> moonip (n.) - One of keizaLove 's udders.
[02:33:17] <Clyph> @PurplePirate_ havent seen him since elementary school
[02:33:17] <@%VulshokSorcerer> *away
[02:33:19] <%Zerkiiee> like the whole thing with Lillithmons BDSM outfit, like what the fuck
[02:33:41] <+zapdos23590> I don't know what you're talking about, but that sounds like something I'd like :33c
[02:33:44] <Mefistofelessss> @Clyph "had a friend" did you kill him? monkaS
[02:33:45] <%$Senerio> Ok so a lot. I wasn't sure because the squares are tiny and I am not the best at identifying pokes from their sprites here
[02:33:47] <%Zerkiiee> LUL
[02:33:47] <%$LilyWight> we dont speak of xros wars tbh
[02:34:01] <Clyph> @Mefistofelessss IVE BEEN FOUND OUT
[02:34:02] <PurplePirate_> @Clyph rip shiny altaria :(
[02:34:10] <+ShironRedshift> Xros Wars is great though. Young Hunters is trash, but Xros Wars is great.
[02:34:15] <%$LilyWight> yeah
[02:34:22] <%$LilyWight> that's what I mean
[02:34:30] <Mefistofelessss> @Clyph justified
[02:34:32] <%$LilyWight> I don't know how appli did though
[02:34:42] <%Zerkiiee> I wouldnt know
[02:34:43] <%donjuan_> Is there a FAQ or something about what the colors mean on the table? I'm new to catch 'em all runs and I feel dumb lol
[02:34:47] <%Zerkiiee> !356
[02:34:48] <@%VulshokSorcerer> !386
[02:34:48] <@%BotGotsThis> White = No info | Blue = Info | Black = Owned | Red = Can do more with Pokemon (quick evo, trade, et cetera)
[02:34:55] <%donjuan_> thanks!!
[02:34:55] <%Zerkiiee> oh 386. I smrt
[02:35:10] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I kinda wish I had played some of the Digimon games
[02:35:16] <%$LilyWight> Some are really nice
[02:35:19] <%$LilyWight> most age quickly
[02:35:20] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but they were all PS games when I didn't have a playstation
[02:35:25] <%Zerkiiee> Yeah
[02:35:33] <StarStalker__> like digimon world 3? Kappa
[02:35:39] <%$LilyWight> The PS1 games really feel archaic, honestly
[02:35:40] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and once I did have a playstation, I wasn't really into Digimon as much
[02:35:42] <%Zerkiiee> I want to speedrun it
[02:35:46] <StarStalker__> digimon world 3 has a sick card game
[02:35:53] <%Esperinforce> I want to try Cyber Sleuth
[02:35:54] <%Zerkiiee> The Card Game is awesome
[02:35:58] <@%VulshokSorcerer> not that I don't still remember it well, but there were other games I wanted to play more
[02:35:59] <Clyph> man i really wish i could watch the rest of this stream but i gotta go to bed in like 30 mins FeelsBadMan
[02:36:11] <%$LilyWight> Rumble Arena

[02:36:15] <%$LilyWight> is my jam
[02:36:22] <%Zerkiiee> I got that game
[02:36:25] <%Zerkiiee> Oh
[02:36:29] <%$LilyWight> Battle Spirit is GBA
[02:36:30] <%Zerkiiee> I got a GBA title
[02:36:32] <+zapdos23590> Digimon DS, Dusk, and Dawn were some of my favorite Digimon games
[02:36:35] <%Zerkiiee> Battle Spirit that is it
[02:36:38] <%$LilyWight> I'd say Re:Digitize Decode is the best, though that's Japanese only
[02:36:41] <%Zerkiiee> It has some amazing sprite work
[02:36:48] <%Zerkiiee> Especially Milleniumnon
[02:36:51] <%$LilyWight> Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's Memory are really good
[02:37:00] <StarStalker__> I played the shit out of digimon DS, it was pretty dece
[02:37:12] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I've heard really good things about Cyber Sleuth
[02:37:14] <%$LilyWight> The DS games are bad with encounter rates
[02:37:15] <Mefistofelessss> I hated this tower as a kid
[02:37:22] <+zapdos23590> Digimon World 2 though muhPoopies muhPoopies muhPoopies
[02:37:23] <%$LilyWight> My favorite on the DS is Championship
[02:37:42] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but I don't have a PS4 or a Vita
[02:37:46] <%$LilyWight> rip
[02:37:55] <Clyph> are legendary encounters also randomized?
[02:37:56] <+zapdos23590> I have it on the Vita, it was fun
[02:37:58] <%$LilyWight> don't blame you about vita
[02:38:01] <%$LilyWight> @Clyph yes
[02:38:02] <StarStalker__> what about digimon data squad? Kappa
[02:38:02] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I keep thinking I should get a Vita, because it has so many good RPGs
[02:38:04] <%$Red_Wavve> Hi Lily
[02:38:07] <+zapdos23590> I need to get the sequel sometime
[02:38:07] <PurplePirate_> running shoes are one of the best things that got added to pokemon games. i just had to say it

[02:38:14] <@%VulshokSorcerer> like every good RPG I hear about anymore seems to have started out on Vita
[02:38:19] <%Zerkiiee> I tried running Digimon World 3 on my 3DS with a playstation homebrew and by god it runs really well before going into a battle
[02:38:19] <%$LilyWight> The Vita is a great JRPG machine
[02:38:21] <PurplePirate_> wow

[02:39:42] <@%VulshokSorcerer> besides that, I've got a PS2, and older nintendo systems
[02:39:48] <%$LilyWight> Worst thing about the Cyber Sleuth games are unskippable cutscenes though
[02:39:48] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I have a PC, but it doesn't work atm
[02:39:53] <%Zerkiiee> Yeah
[02:39:56] <+zapdos23590> Nintendo is amazing

[02:40:03] <Clyph> I just have PC and 3DS
[02:40:22] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I should take my PC to the shop to get fixed, but I keep finding reasons to put it off

[03:17:23] <Varying> pidgeyy PogChamp
[03:17:37] <$TheKingofVithen> if you consider save states into your balance, that's not good design
[03:17:42] <yamiiyami> prism does most of the things right
[03:17:48] <@%VulshokSorcerer> which one is Clover?
[03:17:55] <Starcrytas> hi everyone
[03:18:10] <$TheKingofVithen> Clover is 4chan

[03:19:04] <+Valali> my god

[03:19:18] <$TheKingofVithen> like it's good gameplay wise 4Head
[03:19:19] <%STEELFROST_> so is there always a guaranteed slot for a pokemon you dont have in possession?\
[03:19:30] <yamiiyami> wait why
[03:19:37] <Don> he signed a contract with twitch
[03:19:41] <yamiiyami> oh
[03:19:44] <Globalgamer> partnership terms yeah
[03:20:01] <Globalgamer> Like a non-compete type thing
[03:20:02] <$TheKingofVithen> sandshrew was flipping us off

[03:20:23] <@%BotGotsThis> DansGame WHAT KIND OF RANDO
[03:20:24] <@%VulshokSorcerer> which gen is it based on
[03:20:26] <Mefistofelessss> @TheKingofVithen what game is that
[03:20:31] <%Esperinforce> zMistake
[03:20:31] <@%BotGotsThis> zMistake ™
[03:20:43] <Globalgamer> FR/LG so 3rd yeah
[03:20:44] <$TheKingofVithen> what pokemon clover?
[03:20:45] <%STEELFROST_> not flipping off as much as that clewfairy did in the marathon hahaa
[03:20:50] <%+Mothump> One streamer I watch got a warning from youtube for putting a video up saying he was live on twitch
[03:20:52] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I was asking about prism
[03:21:04] <$TheKingofVithen> Clefairy? ele5REEE
[03:21:11] <Globalgamer> most are based on 2nd or 3rd gen...most of the in-depth ones at least
[03:21:16] <yamiiyami> prism is gen 1-4 mons in gen 2 crystal hack
[03:21:18] <Mefistofelessss> @TheKingofVithen the one with the terrorist
[03:21:23] <$TheKingofVithen> yeah...
[03:21:28] <$TheKingofVithen> it's 4chan the pokemon game
[03:21:31] <$TheKingofVithen> literally
[03:21:35] <yamiiyami> 2new types
[03:21:36] <$TheKingofVithen> that is literally what it is
[03:21:46] <$TheKingofVithen> and it is both the best and worst thing ever
[03:21:47] <@%VulshokSorcerer> what are the new types?
[03:21:48] <Mefistofelessss> how did that came to be
[03:21:51] <%Zerkiiee> Basically youtubers who are streamers go back to the "upload a video" notification
[03:21:53] <yamiiyami> Gas and Sound
[03:21:55] <Mefistofelessss> sounds funny
[03:21:57] <@%VulshokSorcerer> huh
[03:21:57] <@%BotGotsThis> huh™
[03:21:57] <$TheKingofVithen> people on 4chan made it
[03:22:00] <$TheKingofVithen> how else
[03:22:13] <yamiiyami> pokemons like koffing are poison gas for example
[03:22:14] <@%VulshokSorcerer> are there fakemon, or just those types on old pokes?
[03:22:23] <yamiiyami> there are fake mons
[03:22:30] <yamiiyami> but these are optional legends
[03:22:37] <$TheKingofVithen> gas type is weird to me
[03:22:48] <%STEELFROST_> Oh Keiz, you wanna know how trolly Union Cave is in HGSS?
[03:22:51] <yamiiyami> sound type is so small that gym with it uses electric types...
[03:22:52] <$TheKingofVithen> probably has more pokemon than ice still 4Head
[03:23:01] <Globalgamer> gas type is weak to fire because it combusts for example
[03:23:14] <yamiiyami> sound is good vs fairy or something
[03:23:19] <yamiiyami> and steel?
[03:23:21] <$TheKingofVithen> I mean gen 4's fire eleite 4 was worse
[03:23:22] <%STEELFROST_> I killed an onix by mistake and learned the hard way it was weak to water gun... it didnt come back for another 20 minutes
[03:23:22] <Starcrytas> why have 2 timers?
[03:23:35] <@%VulshokSorcerer> one for stream one for run
[03:23:41] <@%VulshokSorcerer> since sellout will be longer than one game
[03:23:51] <@%KirbymastaH> demFesCat CAT ATTACK demFesCat

[03:24:21] <$TheKingofVithen> it is 4chan the game
[03:24:32] <yamiiyami> clover npcs

[03:24:46] <Varying> LUL
[03:24:47] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> """young"""
[03:24:48] <yamiiyami> like the text is pretty fun
[03:24:50] <%Zerkiiee> What kind of radiation were they exposed to
[03:24:56] <%whit_send> I was going to comment on that but could have sworn I misread fuzzyDuck
[03:24:57] <$TheKingofVithen> idk
[03:25:04] <$TheKingofVithen> is there a radiation type?
[03:25:06] <Mefistofelessss> Looks to have actual quality tough
[03:25:12] <Globalgamer> the guy who goes on for 5 minutes about Linux for example yami
[03:25:14] <yamiiyami> nah
[03:25:18] <$TheKingofVithen> it does is the best part
[03:25:23] <Mefistofelessss> @TheKingofVithen play uranium
[03:25:31] <$TheKingofVithen> no
[03:25:43] <Mefistofelessss> Uranium is legit GREAT tough
[03:25:46] <$TheKingofVithen> I prefer thorium thank you
[03:26:04] <Mefistofelessss> Is there a wiki where I can see all the fakemons for clover, I want to plan out my team
[03:26:12] <yamiiyami> there is Fire/Ghost KKK pokemon iiirc
[03:26:12] <$TheKingofVithen> there's a list somewhere
[03:26:24] <$TheKingofVithen> there's a dead chancey like pokemon
[03:26:51] <%$Senerio> I liked the fakemon eevee from Uranium but beyond that it was ok
[03:27:16] <@%KirbymastaH> i don't get why it would "ruin the experience"
[03:27:21] <@%KirbymastaH> most play it only once lol
[03:27:28] <@%KirbymastaH> i don't get "permanent random" factors like that
[03:27:30] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> Isn't Knock Off this Gen a permanent thing?
[03:27:34] <$adamdotpng> sounds like they don't want to put in the work
[03:27:34] <Mefistofelessss> damn, that sucks
[03:27:35] <winnipegxhardcore> lol
[03:27:36] <@%KirbymastaH> unless the game is specifically designed to be replayed multilpe times
[03:27:38] <@%KirbymastaH> (most aren't)
[03:27:38] <%STEELFROST_> Are there any like Romhacks or fan games of pokemon that are really hard and aren't like a nuzlocke challenge?
[03:27:39] <@%KirbymastaH> it's dumb
[03:27:43] <@%KirbymastaH> banjo tooie is a key example
[03:27:45] <@%KirbymastaH> it's a collectathon
[03:27:46] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> Ah
[03:27:49] <@%KirbymastaH> with soooo much unnecessary stupid luck
[03:27:49] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> i dont get why they cant have a Speedrun mode where it is static
[03:27:52] <@%KirbymastaH> that differs based off of file
[03:27:55] <@%KirbymastaH> i don't get it
[03:27:57] <@%KirbymastaH> it's just dumb
[03:28:08] <@%KirbymastaH> and it's not a game well-built for a full replay
[03:28:12] <ジェーり (gerry1888ofyt)> which game you were talking about?
[03:28:44] <yamiiyami> have you played prism and reborn yet Keiz

[03:29:56] <yamiiyami> whats your fav move
[03:30:12] <$TheKingofVithen> also razor wind
[03:30:19] <%Dakitteh> you monster
[03:30:27] <yamiiyami> overall
[03:30:29] <@%VulshokSorcerer> outside rando then
[03:30:43] <Mefistofelessss> mine is meteor mash
[03:31:04] <yamiiyami> I have sweet spot for flamethrower
[03:31:15] <%Zerkiiee> And yet its still managed to get out into the wold
[03:31:17] <%Zerkiiee> *wild
[03:31:17] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> the game ended up getting leaked though, because of course it did
[03:31:23] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> prism had a dev team of 20+ people
[03:31:23] <@%KirbymastaH> i like drill peck a lot

[03:31:25] <@%BotGotsThis> keizaNeat ™
[03:31:32] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> of course someone that had access to the source would leak it
[03:32:12] <Mefistofelessss> you would have gotten 100 once
[03:32:50] <@%VulshokSorcerer> is that the last slot?
[03:33:09] <@%VulshokSorcerer> !last
[03:33:09] <@%BotGotsThis> "Show me the last encounter slot, please, so I can move on with my life." - Every catch em all runner, all the time.
[03:33:12] <Globalgamer> it just seems weird, of all the Pokemon romhacks and fan games to put a C&D on why Prism? Because of the dev team size or something?
[03:33:20] <%LanScoots> howdy keiz
[03:33:38] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> the trailer for it got 1.2 million views...
[03:33:41] <Globalgamer> OH...yeah, that's a big no-no
[03:33:42] <%Zerkiiee> Yeah...
[03:33:47] <%LanScoots> i'm alright, happy to be off work
[03:33:50] <Mefistofelessss> what rookie mistake
[03:33:51] <%Zerkiiee> If you're going to release a ROM Hack you don't do that LUL
[03:34:15] <Globalgamer> all that work flushed down the toilet in one video FeelsBadMan
[03:34:16] <%LanScoots> i survived, give me a medal
[03:34:23] <yamiiyami> Keiza romhack would replace every pokemon with Jynx
[03:34:30] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> of course by some stroke of dumb luck, the C&D only affects Nsomniarts (Koolboyman & Sotomura)
[03:34:39] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> 0.91 has Phlox Skip
[03:34:47] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> theres this sequence break you can do

[03:44:51] <%STEELFROST_> Torwartle
[03:45:06] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Flame Dance or Fire Dance should totally be a move though
[03:45:12] <StarStalker__> warturtle is a war veteran who is also a turtle
[03:45:15] <@%VulshokSorcerer> not sure who would have it, but it sounds like it should exist
[03:45:18] <+thetnacrimson> Flame Dance is a move....
[03:45:22] <@%VulshokSorcerer> is it?
[03:45:25] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> Firey Dance is a move, I believe
[03:45:29] <+thetnacrimson> ^ ye
[03:45:30] <%$laxey4> did you guys know that wartortle is utterly useless in crystal anniversary edition?
[03:45:31] <VzVegeta> No he's a turtle at war

[04:44:48] <@%VulshokSorcerer> 15 seems doable if you don't get too screwed over by things

[05:07:14] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so we had so much longer to go for it
[05:07:16] <%LanScoots> i stepped away for a moment and i see 1s, are we hating video games?
[05:07:21] <@%VulshokSorcerer> yes
[05:07:25] <@%VulshokSorcerer> cuz rock smash rng
[05:07:26] <%LanScoots> 1

[05:07:39] <白いオオカミ (snowwolf_bravo)> you know Keiz so well @LanScoots
[05:07:53] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> i can check
[05:07:55] <%LanScoots> i've been to one or two streams lol
[05:08:11] <@%VulshokSorcerer> also, while Revo is confirming things, we should confirm 5 slots
[05:08:23] <@%VulshokSorcerer> cuz I sort of remember 3, which would be less awful

[05:09:06] <Timmipotop> The following is a line from the log for my rando save: Set #18 - ROUTE 111 Rock Smash (rate=20) - Ditto Lvs 10-15, Milotic Lvs 5-10, Stantler Lvs 15-20, Kirlia Lvs 15-20, Octillery Lvs 15-20
[05:09:07] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> rock is treated the same as water, and its NOT easy to change that
[05:09:10] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> so 5 slots
[05:09:24] <Mefistofelessss> 2 more thingies

[05:25:30] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Gardivore is the regular fetish dream
[05:25:40] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> Ill tell you why I misread the ability code, for 2 reasons, 1 is I suck, 2 is because the game ignores abilities SOMETIMES when calculating wild encounter rate. turns out it ignores abilities for rock smash, but it does affect the encounter rate for literally everything else: and the function is passed a 1 (for true, to ignore abilities) for rock smash, which i somehow missed
[05:25:44] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> there's your explanation
[05:25:55] <+ChampionBeef> blaziken is tied with lopunny from what ive seen

[05:32:29] <%Dakitteh> 1 if there's ramen :3c
[05:32:30] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> also, if im reading the gen 3 code right: even if your encounter rate is "100%" (internally 2880), the game has a 1/2880 chance of failing anyway

[05:32:34] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> aka, a gen 3 miss

[05:32:45] <@%VulshokSorcerer> you can gen1 miss encounters?
[05:32:49] <@%Sly_Envy> @harKazoid86 hey
[05:33:04] <@%VulshokSorcerer> you know, Game Freak makes good games, but they don't necessarily make them well
[05:33:05] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> so, if i made rock smash encounters 100%....
[05:33:09] <%白いオオカミ (snowwolf_bravo)> MingLee is what you mean @thegaymer1993
[05:33:10] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> a miss would be a great meme.
[05:33:12] <@%Sly_Envy> its 1033pm right vul?
[05:33:18] <@%VulshokSorcerer> yes
[05:33:22] <+thegaymer1993> MingLee
[05:33:22] <@%VulshokSorcerer> for me at least
[05:33:27] <@%Sly_Envy> its 833pm for me
[05:33:34] <Mefistofelessss> @ProjectRevoTPP the return of the gen 1 miss
[05:33:40] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> this is because the maximum internal rate is 2880, which is flattened by the code
[05:33:43] <%白いオオカミ (snowwolf_bravo)> Are you in Cali @Sly_Envy
[05:33:46] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> and when it passes the rate in for the modulo
[05:33:51] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> it does Random() % 2880 < rate
[05:33:56] <@%Sly_Envy> @白いオオカミ no in az
[05:34:04] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> but if the maximum rate is 2880, 100%, that means Random() being 0 will fail
[05:34:04] <%$theshoover> monkaS
[05:34:08] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> because remainder is 2880
[05:34:08] <+tctrain> NotLikeThis
[05:34:19] <@%VulshokSorcerer> oh right, cuz AZ plays games with DST
[05:34:30] <@%Sly_Envy> we dont do dst
[05:34:31] <+DWSGatewalker> so what kind of pizza did you get?
[05:34:38] <%Zerkiiee> We need a keizaBlood emote now
[05:34:38] <%白いオオカミ (snowwolf_bravo)> Arizona is 3 hours behind est? I thought it was in central with 1 hour behind
[05:34:47] <%Zerkiiee> with a blood thirsty Keizaron face
[05:34:50] <Mefistofelessss> that's boring
[05:34:58] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Arizona moves, because they don't do DST like the rest of the US
[05:35:04] <+DWSGatewalker> not bad. I'll usually do chicken + onions for pizza
[05:35:11] <%Zerkiiee> Simple pizzas are better
[05:35:13] <$bbean> what is on the other one?
[05:35:14] <+DWSGatewalker> or sausage + peppers
[05:35:20] <Mefistofelessss> If I weren't on a cut I would ask a ridiculous pizza tomorrow
[05:35:21] <$expiredbeetle69> who cares how boring as long as its not pineapple
[05:35:25] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so they're on Pacific in the Summer, and Mountain in the Winter

[05:36:42] <+tctrain> Bacon and onion is my favorite combo
[05:37:03] <@%VulshokSorcerer> the ice cave in vanilla is the only place to get spheal and snorunt

[05:37:13] <$bbean> i have come to like cheese + pineapple though occassionally not often *fight me*
[05:37:20] <Mefistofelessss> whats a margarita pizza
[05:37:25] <+thegaymer1993> what is a margarita pizza?
[05:37:27] <Kingkong_21> Either margarita or mozzarella pizza for me
[05:37:33] <$bbean> yes pineapple is very good on pizza

[05:38:38] <Mefistofelessss> Pineapple is GLORIOUS moon2H
[05:38:40] <$bbean> but not ok pineapple is awesome
[05:38:48] <VzVegeta> I had a Hawaiian pie (pineapple with ham) pizza and it was better than expected
[05:38:57] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Keiz is allergic to pineapple, so he has cause
[05:39:04] <Kingkong_21> If someone likes pineapple on pizza he lost the right to get treated fairly
[05:39:15] <$expiredbeetle69> i would genuinly rather be diagnosed with cancer than have to eat a whole pinapple
[05:39:18] <byte_sized> tomato is a fruit that is on pizza tho
[05:39:23] <Mefistofelessss> Oh we call "margarita" "cappresse" where I live. Probably because we are cultured people Kappa
[05:39:29] <byte_sized> so why can't pineapple be on it?
[05:39:29] <$bbean> l like bacon + pineapple better than ham with pineapple personally if i am going outside the box more

[05:46:33] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I couldn't remember
[05:46:42] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so it just changes which slots you can access, not the slots themselves
[05:46:52] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> funny thing about Shoal Cave: it is the only map for which a "warp-based Hall of Fame" wrong warp can actually work, because that door tile is on the exact same x, y as the HOF door trigger

[06:44:17] <%whit_send> Pretty much all the white fish in the desert?
[06:44:26] <samofthesuper> I’m gonna backseat game, that way it’s like suicide.
[06:44:27] <@%VulshokSorcerer> to be fair, there are a lot of water types, and randomizing them into water routes wouldn't be very randomized

[07:35:12] <@%BotGotsThis> vulshoksorcerer -> !subpoints was updated successfully
[07:35:27] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Gen 7 doesn't have a randomizer, does it
[07:35:29] <@%VulshokSorcerer> ?]
[07:35:34] <lurkerSM> i don't think so
[07:35:40] <%$yarts> Speedo Boy wants to battle
[07:35:47] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so we'd need a randomizer for gen7 first
[07:35:50] <$willshpt> Well let’s make one
[07:35:57] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Dabom's rando only goes up to gen5
[07:36:25] <lurkerSM> never mind, sun/moon randos exist
[07:36:29] <lurkerSM> apparently
[07:36:41] <@%$LilyWight> yeah
[07:36:51] <@%$LilyWight> there's 3DS randos, just not by dabom
[07:36:51] <$willshpt> Well is there a catch em all for it?
[07:36:53] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> gen 6 and gen 7 rando require CFW and unpacking/repacking 3DS roms and randomizing the contents using pk3DS
[07:36:59] <DonkinCronkin> i emerge from the void unscathed. theres a surprising amount of hot singles in my area even there monkaS
[07:37:05] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> ive done it before, but it suuuuuucks
[07:37:11] <$Jirachimaster> gen 6 and 7 randomizers are hard to set up
[07:37:15] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I'd assume most pokemon randomizers have a catch-em-all option
[07:37:17] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but they might not
[07:37:21] <Kanonhime> It's time-consuming more than anything.
[07:37:55] <@%VulshokSorcerer> just realized your Kingdra is at 200 hp
[07:37:57] <@%VulshokSorcerer> nice
[07:38:31] <Kanonhime> Screwing up CFW, or screwing up the randomizer? Both are very difficult to screw up.
[07:38:39] <%$Senerio> It's always amusing to me to see who dies when you need blood sacrifices
[07:38:59] <%Esperinforce> keizaLuck Crossing my fingers to not stay here forever
[07:39:13] <$Jirachimaster> i need to get a new 3ds the back of my current one is breaking to where i can see the battery
[07:39:18] <%dandaman377> my 3ds is running cfw
[07:39:26] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> yeah, CFW has gotten to the point where its easy to install it and hard to brick it
[07:39:27] <%dandaman377> i just don't know what i wanna play now
[07:39:31] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> it used to be the other way around
[07:39:42] <Kanonhime> It's virtually impossible to brick without actively trying these days.
[07:40:05] <%Technetium43> u right
[07:40:05] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> !keizaluck
[07:40:05] <@%BotGotsThis> Keizaron has a luck that is unluck any other person's luck. For Keizaron will always get the shittest of lucker from the game, no matter what the odds of the unluck may be. He will always cause the DansGame and KeizaRage . The PJSalt is to be had by all, until everything tastes of PJSalt .
[07:40:07] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> so we just need a comprehensive, keiz-friendly guide that even Keizaron cant fuck up
[07:40:08] <@%VulshokSorcerer> we have
[07:40:09] <%Dakitteh> keizaLuck
[07:40:11] <%Esperinforce> And I remember those days. It was scary getting CFW on my nds3
[07:40:15] <@%VulshokSorcerer> we have had 13 hours of it on full display
[07:40:17] <@%Medicean> your luck is great Kappa

PJSalt WIRD VON ALLEN BENUTZT WERDEN, BIS ALLES NACH PJSalt SCHMECKT.
[07:40:22] <Kanonhime> Revo, that guide already exists.
[07:40:37] <$Jirachimaster> u have better luck then me XD
[07:40:39] <@%VulshokSorcerer> is the abandoned ship worth?
[07:40:47] <%$Senerio> You should do it (to your spare 3DS) anyway because it'd be a funny reaction imo
[07:40:59] <@%VulshokSorcerer> how many slots does the ship actually have?
[07:41:11] <$willshpt> @kanonhime @projectrevotpp it’s not possible to make a guide Keiz can’t fuck up
[07:41:13] <@%VulshokSorcerer> fair enough
[07:41:25] <$willshpt> Kappa
[07:41:28] <@%VulshokSorcerer> two sets of water?
[07:41:33] <Kanonhime> @willshpt I say the guide exists, because I succeeded even after screwing it up myself.
[07:42:07] <%Esperinforce> But I'm not on the scene for a very long time. But I wonder if the nintendo ban wave is still ongoing
[07:42:43] <%Esperinforce> *Too this day, scared to turn on my wifi*
[07:43:02] <Kanonhime> You can turn on your wifi, Esper.
[07:43:12] <%Esperinforce> o;
[07:43:34] <$willshpt> No unplug your modem throw it out the window notHING IS SAFE
[07:43:38] <%Esperinforce> Well then I'm happy
[07:43:49] <Kanonhime> I've traded Pokémon over the Internet many times since I first hacked my 3DS, and I'm not banned. Just don't do anything stupid like play a game online before it's released/

[08:05:21] <lurkerSM> shout out to double wobbuffet softlocking this game
[08:05:38] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> That's a siutation only achievable in wi-fi or randos
[08:05:41] <@%VulshokSorcerer> like, Run Away is on Rat line, Pony line, Do line (which we don't have), Sentret line, Eevee, Aipom, and Pooch
[08:05:51] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> And very unlikely in randos due to move randomization
[08:05:54] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so that's a lot of options, if Keiz wants to do it
[08:05:55] <lurkerSM> still though
[08:06:18] <+Stupid_Pokenerd> I guess /shrug
[08:06:23] <@%VulshokSorcerer> also not a soft lock, cuz struggle eventually

[08:18:15] <@%VulshokSorcerer> it might be the rando gives slots to them anyway?

[08:22:31] <@%VulshokSorcerer> yes, but we knew that already

[08:25:49] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> the fix im eventually going to do is to make altering slots depend on your money's ten or hundreds digit

[08:25:54] <%Esperinforce> This is just like

[08:40:45] <themasterofw> Well you cant catch some evolve forms so you'd have to level a lot..
[08:40:57] <Khanadian1> alomomola should have evolved from luvdisc
[08:40:59] <@%VulshokSorcerer> also that
[08:41:05] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and with non-randomizer levelling
[08:41:08] <skullflesh> am i the only one here who has a legit shiny ralts while searching for a zigzagoon
[08:41:17] <@%VulshokSorcerer> probably
[08:41:18] <@%$Raveen92> hey keiz, if you want to buy new games at all, use my phone number at best buy for 20% off
[08:41:36] <Ryziken> Unown should have evolved to Siglyph or whatever it was
[08:41:37] <Khanadian1> why'd he catch a flaaffy if he has an ampharos?
[08:41:47] <@%VulshokSorcerer> cuz he needed Flaffy still
[08:41:52] <%Esperinforce> !charm
[08:41:53] <@%BotGotsThis> For Keiz so loved the world that he gave his one and only Run, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal Charm. -Crystal 3:16
[08:41:57] <lurkerSM> unown into sigilyph would be odd
[08:41:58] <Khanadian1> just breed
