[23:14:36] <@%VulshokSorcerer> hey Sly
[23:14:44] MOD: VulshokSorcerer
[23:14:49] <@%Sly_Envy> hey vul
[23:14:55] <bertutoto_krieger> @Keizaron is there such a thing as biggest battle tower streak world record?
[23:14:55] <%$recklessGreed> I love the Ygo Twitch Emotes :( Too bad there is no RecklessGreed Emote (yet)
[23:15:05] <@%Sly_Envy> i just had cheeseburgers for dinner keiz
[23:15:27] <loa90> what kind of cheesburger?
[23:15:29] <@%Sly_Envy> its 215pm as well
[23:15:40] <bertutoto_krieger> @Keizaron would probably hard to get something like that verified..
[23:15:59] <Hypelastika> KappaPride
[23:16:03] <+lukewarmslickings> KappaPride
[23:16:55] <@%Sly_Envy> hey tyrant on call
[23:17:05] <bertutoto_krieger> @Keizaron only proof you can show is a picture or video where it says your streak is xxxx big ðŸ¤”
[23:17:11] <@%Sly_Envy> hows tyrant?
[23:17:43] <bertutoto_krieger> @Keizaron I might twitch stream the whole process PogChamp
[23:18:00] <bertutoto_krieger> yeah
[23:18:44] <bertutoto_krieger> Thought about going for that record for some time, but I just yet now realized it's a matter of trust to verify it :/
[23:19:08] <bertutoto_krieger> oh well
[23:19:19] <lordariados67> im definitely gonna try fm, any warnings?
[23:19:38] <Hypelastika> btw Keiz is there an easy way to memorize rock tunnel i get lost so easly ? NotLikeThis
[23:19:39] <%$recklessGreed> lordariados67 you will go crazy! 
[23:19:59] <bertutoto_krieger> what's the biggest difference in rulings between forbidden memories and the "normal" yu-gi-oh?
[23:20:11] <bertutoto_krieger> LUL
[23:20:19] <+ChampionBeef> it has a rule
[23:20:23] <+ChampionBeef> you can only play 1 card a turn
[23:20:27] <@%VulshokSorcerer> effectively FM is one play per turn (magic or monster)
[23:20:29] <lordariados67> ill probably have a fusion chart on hand while playing fm
[23:20:38] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but you can fuse without needing a card for it
[23:20:39] <Hypelastika> thats a good rule PogChamp
[23:20:41] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and fusions are bullshit
[23:20:50] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> Fusion works differently, you can only place one card on the field per turn, and you always draw to a hand of 5
[23:20:51] <@%VulshokSorcerer> there are also rituals, which are even more bullshit
[23:20:51] <%+Sandpai> Mushman hype
[23:20:57] <bertutoto_krieger> Does this game have spell/trap cards and effect monsters?
[23:21:04] <@%VulshokSorcerer> @GarfieldTheLightning that is a real good sum up
[23:21:07] <@%VulshokSorcerer> no effect monsters
[23:21:18] <@%VulshokSorcerer> does have spells/traps, but some work differently
[23:21:25] <%$recklessGreed> Take a scissor and create a WHOLE NEW CARD :D 
[23:21:44] <+A3r1uS> Back
[23:21:51] <@%VulshokSorcerer> every deck gets a bunch of random monsters, one destruction spell (dark hole or raigeki), one field spell, and one equip
[23:21:58] <+A3r1uS> Looks like Rex's doing Rex stuff Kappa
[23:22:03] <@%Sly_Envy> hi @A3r1uS @annoyedAlchemist hi
[23:22:04] <bertutoto_krieger> you don't need polymerization to fuse?
[23:22:09] <%+Sandpai> nope
[23:22:09] <@%BotGotsThis> nopeâ„¢
[23:22:11] <@%VulshokSorcerer> nope
[23:22:11] <@%BotGotsThis> nopeâ„¢
[23:22:17] <Hypelastika> polymerization LUL
[23:22:22] <+A3r1uS> Sly KonCha
[23:22:22] <lordariados67> how are decks determined, like the same as dotr
[23:22:24] <bertutoto_krieger> you just make them do a fusion dance Kappa
[23:22:37] <@%VulshokSorcerer> see my earlier comment for how initial decks are set
[23:22:47] <SchwarzRin> Megamorph doesnâ€™t exist.
[23:22:50] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> Also there are guardian stars in this game, where you gain 500 atk/def points if you have amonster with a favourable guardian star matchup
[23:22:54] <%$recklessGreed> What are the two Symbols / Planets for? 
[23:22:58] <bertutoto_krieger> @Keizaron Can everything fuse with everything?!
[23:22:59] <@%Sly_Envy> tyrant good today keiz?
[23:23:03] <@%VulshokSorcerer> not quite
[23:23:03] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> Those are guardian stars
[23:23:05] <%$recklessGreed> ahhh thanks Garf ^^ 
[23:23:07] <@%Sly_Envy> hi garf
[23:23:09] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but lots of things can fuse with lots of other things
[23:23:18] <@%VulshokSorcerer> if you want a guide to fusions, there's some good ones out there
[23:23:36] <@%VulshokSorcerer> https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/561010-yu-gi-oh-forbidden-memories/faqs/16613 <- this is a real good fusion guide if you're interested
[23:23:42] <%$tctrain> keizaW
[23:23:43] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> What are you racing?
[23:23:47] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but even that's not 100% complete, because the game is dumb
[23:23:47] <bertutoto_krieger> @VulshokSorcerer thanks
[23:23:51] <lordariados67> oh, i mean what decks are available at the start? and how that is determined, i hope that clears it up
[23:23:55] <@%Sly_Envy> keizaHey @GarfieldTheLightning
[23:24:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> oh, starting decks are random
[23:24:07] <%+Sandpai> i think its a redemption run for last night
[23:24:09] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> What time are you starting?
[23:24:11] <@%Sly_Envy> @tctrain keizaHey
[23:24:11] <+A3r1uS> Wednesday race PogChamp
[23:24:12] <bertutoto_krieger> @VulshokSorcerer do you like this game better than regular yu-gi-oh?
[23:24:16] <+A3r1uS> What time?
[23:24:21] <%$tctrain> Hi sly
[23:24:30] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I do, but I feel like regular yu-gi-oh can be both complicated and obscure
[23:24:41] <@%VulshokSorcerer> whereas this is obscure but straightforward
[23:24:43] <bertutoto_krieger> A rare magic card PogChamp
[23:24:45] <%$tctrain> Both sides get to play the game in FM, so it's better than yugioh keizaW
[23:24:58] <lordariados67> rando starting decks, aw, no name manip for good decks like in dotr, oh well
[23:25:14] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so once you learn the basics, you pretty much know the game, even if final 6 is utter bullshit
[23:25:45] <@%VulshokSorcerer> well, you can manip decks lord, sort of, but mostly you just manip drops
[23:25:45] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> 3 eastern is pretty late if I wanna finish
[23:26:06] <+A3r1uS> Isn't that like 9pm my time?
[23:26:07] <akistolol> hi
[23:26:18] <Joester98> gl keiz joestePac
[23:26:30] <%Zexion6> Hey im vack
[23:26:32] <+A3r1uS> Akisto KonCha
[23:26:37] <%Zexion6> Back
[23:26:40] <@%Sly_Envy> yo zexion
[23:26:41] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> I probably don't know the game well enough yet anyway, so don't worry too much about accommodating me
[23:26:57] <%Zexion6> Hey sly
[23:26:58] <@%Sly_Envy> hiya garf
[23:27:12] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> Hi SLy
[23:27:16] <lordariados67> i feel like once i start fm, itll make more sense
[23:27:31] <%Zexion6> Sly, do you do bingo's?
[23:27:38] <@%Sly_Envy> i dont
[23:27:43] <%Zexion6> K
[23:27:46] <%$tctrain> PogChamp
[23:27:55] <Hypelastika> dragon PogChamp ?
[23:28:04] <bertutoto_krieger> @Keizaron what's the hardest opponent in this game?
[23:28:05] <%$tctrain> Really good dragon
[23:28:15] <+A3r1uS> DarkNite
[23:28:17] <+A3r1uS> OP as fuck
[23:28:27] <Hypelastika> A3r1uS LUL
[23:28:54] <%$tctrain> Kappa
[23:28:58] <Hypelastika> Kappa b
[23:29:34] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> Wait, Seto's kind of your rival, and although he's Seto 3rd it's the second time you duel him... so basically you're saying that Rival 2 is the hardest fight in this game
[23:29:38] <lordariados67> in xd, there is a hyper beam bear route
[23:29:40] <@%VulshokSorcerer> @bertutoto_krieger if you're not familiar, you have to fight the last 6 duels in the game all in a row, without saving. and any of them (but particularly the last 3) can just decide that you don't win that day
[23:30:10] <+A3r1uS> I would say the last 4
[23:30:25] <@%VulshokSorcerer> @GarfieldTheLightning what's even better is that depending on how you play Seto 3 might even be the first time you fight Seto
[23:30:30] <+A3r1uS> Heishin EZ mode is a problem
[23:30:32] <%+Corvalus11> @GarfieldTheLightning or heishin 2 since he beats you at the start
[23:30:38] <@%Sly_Envy> hey corva
[23:30:39] <@%VulshokSorcerer> @A3r1uS I was debating whether to include Heishin
[23:30:42] <%+Corvalus11> hey sly
[23:31:57] <%+Corvalus11> wait what if rival 2 stands for both of the rival rematches?
[23:32:24] <@%+GarfieldTheLightning> 2 rival 2s?? No wonder this game is so brutal
[23:32:32] <+A3r1uS> I still consider Heishin 1 to be harder than Heishin 2
[23:33:27] <%+thetnacrimson> Whats your equip?
[23:33:46] <%+thetnacrimson> Gumo!!!!
[23:33:51] <Hypelastika> hard mode WutFace
[23:34:03] <akistolol> strimer why are there no splits?
[23:34:04] <%+Sandpai> villager number 3 hardest fight
[23:34:33] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Weevil's AI is so dumb
[23:34:40] <+A3r1uS> My first split is "Farm 2"
[23:34:41] <Hypelastika> hardest fight is shadi SpookyPumpking
[23:34:54] <@%VulshokSorcerer> like, he tend to throw gumo, but if you start in face-down def, he'll also throw gumo in face-down def
[23:35:06] <%+thetnacrimson> @A3r1uS sounds about right
[23:35:14] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and then gumo always dies, cuz it's def is trash
[23:35:58] <+A3r1uS> Everything before farm 2 is pointless on a split
[23:36:03] <+A3r1uS> It's not accurate
[23:36:24] <G_I_R_A_F_F_E> i find the sfx in this game oddly soothing
[23:36:28] <Hypelastika> whats farm 1 then ? Kappa
[23:36:44] <+A3r1uS> Villager 2 and Master K :)
[23:36:47] <+A3r1uS> Or you skip it
[23:36:54] <%+thetnacrimson> Master K farm
[23:36:56] <%+thetnacrimson> legendary
[23:37:02] <@%VulshokSorcerer> do you clear WT before farm 2 A3r1us?
[23:37:07] <+A3r1uS> Yes
[23:37:26] MOD: Exarionu
[23:37:41] <%+thetnacrimson> Holy shit How did u get 2 crawling dragons from Rex
[23:37:49] <@%VulshokSorcerer> he does that a lot recently
[23:38:11] <ThisIsDefinitelyDaWae> HotPokket
[23:38:14] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Keiz gets more Crawling Dragons and Widespreads than anyone I know
[23:38:37] <%+thetnacrimson> here I was convinced CD#2 was like 1/100 duels for rex
[23:38:39] <%eskaria> And fewer Umis than anyone I know
[23:38:45] <%$tctrain> It's not megamorph
[23:38:57] <+A3r1uS> You won't see CD2 on my runs
[23:39:11] <+A3r1uS> Unless it's from Mai or Keith Campaign
[23:39:17] <@%VulshokSorcerer> 72/2048 on SA for CD2
[23:39:48] <%+thetnacrimson> 3.5% chance on rex lol
[23:40:22] <+A3r1uS> B for Beast Fangs
[23:40:24] <@%VulshokSorcerer> still waiting for people to A-tec Rex for Invig
[23:40:25] <+A3r1uS> S for Shit
[23:40:37] <bertutoto_krieger> is this game how yu-gi-oh originally was intented?
[23:40:45] <@%VulshokSorcerer> not really
[23:40:45] <+A3r1uS> I do Atec Seto 1 and Rex campaign if the deck is good enough
[23:40:46] <%+Sandpai> i hope not
[23:40:47] <Hypelastika> yes Kappa
[23:40:53] <@%VulshokSorcerer> this was developed alongside the card gam
[23:40:59] <%+thetnacrimson> seto 1 drops megamorph right?
[23:41:03] <+A3r1uS> No
[23:41:04] <@%VulshokSorcerer> no
[23:41:09] <%+thetnacrimson> oh wait seto 2 does
[23:41:15] <@%VulshokSorcerer> MM is Pegi, both Heishins, and...
[23:41:19] <G_I_R_A_F_F_E> whats the best yugioh game in your opinion?
[23:41:23] <bertutoto_krieger> I don't get why they would release a yu-gi-oh game with slightly different rules :p
[23:41:27] <+A3r1uS> MM is Peggy and Hardest
[23:41:28] <%+thetnacrimson> wait...I am mixing up heishins drop and seto again
[23:41:28] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Darknite
[23:41:31] UNMOD: Lilywight
[23:41:36] Viewerstats (23:11-23:41): avg:88 min:79 max:101 [16/85-6+4+2+0-2+3+0+6+1-6+2+1+4+7-1]
[23:41:41] <Hypelastika> this is best yugioh game
[23:41:42] <%+thetnacrimson> its obviously FalseBound Kingdom
[23:41:44] <bertutoto_krieger> I really like eternal duelist soul
[23:41:47] <bertutoto_krieger> liked
[23:41:50] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Pegi 64, Darknite 48, Heishin 2
[23:42:04] <bertutoto_krieger> @Keizaron what's your favorite card in this game?
[23:42:20] <@%VulshokSorcerer> not Mystical Waifu?
[23:42:20] <%$tctrain> Not hungry burger DansGame
[23:42:22] <Hypelastika> Skull Knight is majinGasm
[23:42:36] <+A3r1uS> It has to be Lord Big Deak
[23:42:44] <%+thetnacrimson> your telling me its not the turtle oath u fused for the other day with your ui
[23:42:47] <@%VulshokSorcerer> we all know Keiz so well
[23:42:54] <bertutoto_krieger> Kuriboh isn't in this game? :(
[23:42:55] <Hypelastika> Big Deak our lord and savior BlessRNG
[23:43:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Kuriboh is in
[23:43:08] <@%VulshokSorcerer> it's just worthless, cuz no effects
[23:43:08] <%$tctrain> So is dank kuriboh
[23:43:12] <bertutoto_krieger> FeelsGoodMan
[23:43:22] <@%VulshokSorcerer> dark kuriboh is more useful, cuz it's Dark Magic
[23:43:31] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so you can use it for Dank Elf
[23:43:32] <bertutoto_krieger> Dark Magic?
[23:43:42] <+A3r1uS> You can't make Dark Elf with Kuriboh
[23:43:44] <Hypelastika> hardest fight in the game right here majinS
[23:43:48] <+A3r1uS> But you can with the fake one
[23:43:49] <%+thetnacrimson> I never realized shadi looks so drugged out in the screen before the duel
[23:43:49] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Dark Magic are cards you can use for fusing Blackland Fire Dragon and Dark Elf
[23:44:07] <@%VulshokSorcerer> with dragons and elves respectively
[23:44:24] <bertutoto_krieger> @VulshokSorcerer if you can fuse monsters without polymerization, why is there a megamorph spell card?
[23:44:24] <@%VulshokSorcerer> dark spellcasters are a special case of dark magic, which can fuse with jars to make Ushi Oni
[23:44:37] <@%VulshokSorcerer> megamorph is a +1000 equip
[23:44:39] <bertutoto_krieger> rulings NotLikeThis
[23:44:42] <@%VulshokSorcerer> which can go on anyone
[23:44:48] <ThisIsDefinitelyDaWae> shadi sucks LUL

[23:52:20] <+A3r1uS> Widespread is the best card of the game

[23:53:13] <+A3r1uS> Dark Hole
[23:53:13] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Geki is probably the best pure "spell"
[23:53:16] <ThisIsDefinitelyDaWae> Raigeki now!!
[23:53:19] <@%VulshokSorcerer> or Dark Hole
[23:53:25] <%+thetnacrimson> really not CCV?
[23:53:26] <@%VulshokSorcerer> MM is the best "magic"
[23:53:28] <bertutoto_krieger> @VulshokSorcerer can he have 3 geki's at this point?
[23:53:31] <@%VulshokSorcerer> no
[23:53:35] <bertutoto_krieger> aw
[23:53:41] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I don't know if Geki even drops from anyone

[23:53:59] <+A3r1uS> Seto 1, Seto 2, Heishin 1, Shadi drops it
[23:53:59] <Hypelastika> wtf LUL
[23:54:04] <%+thetnacrimson> This is the hardest Mode in the world
[23:54:06] <@%VulshokSorcerer> wait, Shadi?
[23:54:07] <ã‚¸ã‚§ãƒ¼ã‚Š (gerry1888ofyt)> https://clips.twitch.tv/KitschyMagnificentAniseYouDontSay
[23:54:09] <bertutoto_krieger> do decks consist of at least 40 cards like in actual yu-gi-oh? @VulshokSorcerer
[23:54:15] <+A3r1uS> From A-tec
[23:54:19] <@%VulshokSorcerer> exactly 40
[23:54:26] <Hypelastika> yugi boi FeelsGoodMan
[23:54:30] <bertutoto_krieger> oh really, so can't have more than 40
[23:54:31] <@%VulshokSorcerer> imagine A-tec Shadi
[23:54:38] <%+Sandpai> looks like im down 2 machines for the night keizaThump
[23:54:44] <@%VulshokSorcerer> !atec btw @bertutoto_krieger
[23:54:45] <@%BotGotsThis> use 37+ cards, 9 turns, 4 effectives attacks, 1 face-down, 15 fusions, 1 equip, 1 pure magic, 1 trap activated, < 7000 LP
[23:54:52] MOD: LilyWight
[23:54:53] <@%VulshokSorcerer> that's the requirements for enemies to drop the best cards
[23:55:11] <bertutoto_krieger> uhh I don't quite understand that
[23:55:13] <@%VulshokSorcerer> most equips and good spells only drop from atec
[23:55:21] <bertutoto_krieger> what do you mean drop?
[23:55:22] <@%VulshokSorcerer> it will make more sense once Keiz starts doing them
[23:55:39] <@%VulshokSorcerer> every duel you get one card, randomly selected from a pool specific to each duelist
[23:55:48] <@%VulshokSorcerer> the pool is further limited by the rating you get in the match
[23:55:56] <%$recklessGreed> Going to bed... Will keep Watchin. See ya Chat
[23:56:04] <@%VulshokSorcerer> SA Pow is one pool, SA Tec is another, and BCD is the third
