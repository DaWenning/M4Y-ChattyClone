[07:49:54] <%+arymilla> I got old and started only drinking weiss beer.
[07:49:55] <@InfiniteDeWitt> Pizza Luce

[07:49:57] <%$Red_Wavve> Speaking of stouts, we got some really good stout from 2014 that had like chocolate, caramel, coffee, a couple other things, and it was SO GOOD
[07:50:04] <%$Red_Wavve> On another one of my trips
[07:50:06] <Slivarito> My favorite stout is The Abyss from Deschutes thaiGasm

[07:51:02] <%$Sandpai> Wasnt he only for one year?
[07:51:08] <$DanGodOfThunder> He couldn't couch either
[07:51:14] <Grene> bonesaw????????? like the RS bonesaw??????
[07:51:15] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> thats what i meant
[07:51:16] <%^Stay_Hydrated_Bot>* @keizaron stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 11 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 44oz (1.32L) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[07:51:18] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> i meant barred lol
[07:51:21] <%Snowbear22> I know every year I see a thread or two of stuff. More so in the past. I still remember the hotel stunt from I think it was 2014?
[07:51:31] <$DanGodOfThunder> @ProjectRevoTPP He could have had a run in at AGDQ 2018 if he wanted.
[07:51:50] <+your__name__here> most of the stuff in those reddit threads is made up entirely
[07:52:08] <Grene> I know you used to be a RS player, was the bonesaw you were refering to as that person?
[07:52:11] <Slivarito> I have a problem with you, I keep missing your streams moon2FEELS
[07:52:48] <Slivarito> Drama gets on my nerves, I just have no time for it cryShrug
[07:53:07] <$DanGodOfThunder> @Grene Bonesaw577. He may have played RS in the past, but I couldn't say
[07:53:09] <$willshpt> tghHi Keiz!
[07:53:10] <%$Red_Wavve> It was nice going out for Dairy Queen, and hopefully at least that was less drama :D
[07:53:14] <Grene> Yea, you didnt pay for that BS. Hope it was still good for you overal
[07:53:49] <@InfiniteDeWitt> it wasn't even really drama
[07:53:49] <Grene> @DanGodOfThunder my guess is someone different then :P
[07:54:06] <$willshpt> I completely missed what drama you r talking about
[07:54:10] <@InfiniteDeWitt> it was someone being in denial
[07:54:26] <$DanGodOfThunder> Hence toleration. SeemsGood
[07:54:36] <Grene> I dont always drink, but when I do... it is nights like tonight :)
[07:54:57] <$willshpt> Why is Keizâ€™s hair invisible? tghOnionHD
[07:54:59] <scathee_> are you allowed to have notes during gdq runs?
[07:55:28] <Grene> ....i cant remember like 90% of my childhood and my wife flips over it... are you similar?
[07:55:31] <@InfiniteDeWitt> I wasn't even really a babysitter

[08:01:19] <$DanGodOfThunder> Hmmm. I haven't played in a while, but I've only heard it as you needing to run the table on Redemption.
[08:01:21] MOD: Haushana
[08:01:25] <Grene> I have noticed like every county around me has different rules....
[08:01:54] <$DanGodOfThunder> I will tear my face off with a belt sander before I look up official rules for Beer Pong.
[08:02:08] <Grene> thats a BS rule LUL
[08:02:10] <$willshpt> Official rules pshhh just play beer pong Mao-style
[08:03:47] <$DanGodOfThunder> I'm miserable at beer pong. That's why I started drinking scotch straight. dangodBooze
