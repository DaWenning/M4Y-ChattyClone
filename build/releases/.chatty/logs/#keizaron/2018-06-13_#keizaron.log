[00:31:14] <$G_I_R_A_F_F_E> if it is the case that paras and parasect are being controlled by the fungus in the same manner in which the cordyceps fungus operates then are they not destined to be tactical mushroom nukes?

[00:52:12] <Rhinomnom> Pokemon speedruns are so entertaining to watch, oh lord
[00:52:23] <@%VulshokSorcerer> it would have 3 kinds of pepperoni, but the third topping would have been another dollar and a half
[00:52:35] <$G_I_R_A_F_F_E> what if digletts nose is just another diglett growth
[00:52:48] <%Vadalken> It's catch em all race. It will always be upsetting at some point.
[00:52:51] <%eskaria> That's how he evolves into dugtrio
[00:53:02] <@%Sly_Envy> hi eskaria keizaHey
[00:53:05] <Rhinomnom> Sweet scenting for so long is just amazing
[00:53:06] <%eskaria> the other ones just grows out of his nose
[00:53:10] <%eskaria> Hi Sly!
[00:53:20] <%Vadalken> Dirrent pepperonies. Are we talking brands?
[00:53:30] <%Vadalken> Different*
[00:53:34] <@%VulshokSorcerer> no, just styles
[00:53:48] <%Vadalken> Star shapes?
[00:53:51] <habsare24> what are the color codes
[00:53:52] <Rhinomnom> You have different styles of taste
[00:53:55] <%Vadalken> This is new to me.
[00:54:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> the place I buy, they have a standard pepperoni, a spicy pepperoni, and a diced pepperoni
[00:54:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> !251
[00:54:01] <@%BotGotsThis> White = No info | Blue = Info | Black = Owned | Red = Can do more with Pokemon (quick evo, trade, et cetera)
[00:54:12] <%Vadalken> Oh.
[00:54:12] <habsare24> ty
[00:54:15] <%$laxey4> Oh boy, death!
[00:54:19] <$G_I_R_A_F_F_E> spicy pep
[00:54:23] <Rhinomnom> Every region in Italy has pretty much a different tasting pepperoni iirc
[00:54:31] <%Vadalken> I thought pepperoni was one specific type of sausage.
[00:54:49] <@%VulshokSorcerer> sort of, but there's still variety
[00:54:53] <$G_I_R_A_F_F_E> spicy pep with a nice cheese to cleanse the pallet
[00:54:55] <Rhinomnom> It's a style of sausage, but it's pretty much like bell peppers
[00:54:56] <@%VulshokSorcerer> like all the different salamis
[00:55:00] <Rhinomnom> the colours taste differently
[00:55:00] <%$WoodenBarrel> Aw I was hoping for death
[00:55:01] <%DarvinTheGnome> still have different spice recipes
[00:55:02] <$G_I_R_A_F_F_E> for the perfect adult lunchables
[00:55:06] <%Vadalken> Ok, like bratwurst then.
[00:55:16] <%Vadalken> You learn something every day.
[00:55:16] <@%VulshokSorcerer> yeah, fair comparison
[00:55:26] <Rhinomnom> Every day is a school day
[00:55:34] <%$FearlessLily> Wait. I saw lunchables briefly
[00:55:41] <%$FearlessLily> Now I want one
[00:55:50] <Rhinomnom> They've been gone for ages where I live
[00:55:55] <%Vadalken> Don't keel over. Then the stream will end.
[00:55:55] <$G_I_R_A_F_F_E> yes, adults make their own lunchables

[01:02:49] <@%VulshokSorcerer> are there only 2 rock smash slots for the whole game?
[01:03:10] <%+RNGHater> Maybe combine the trees and make it 4 encounter slots? keizaThink
[01:03:37] <%Vadalken> Can something be only obtainable in safarizone?
[01:03:38] <$G_I_R_A_F_F_E> HEY EVERYBODY IM AZUMARILL
[01:03:52] <@%VulshokSorcerer> yes, something could be safari only
[01:04:00] <%+kzdouglas135> blame revo
[01:04:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> or, it can be in other games
[01:04:04] <@%VulshokSorcerer> which have safari
[01:04:09] <%+RNGHater> Nah, I'm just asking if that would be a good solution.

[01:08:16] <@%VulshokSorcerer> if I knew more about roms, I might try my hand at it, but I REEEEEEEALLLY don't
[01:08:26] <@%+PikalaxALT> vanilla emerald decompilation still needs to be finished
[01:08:28] <%+RNGHater> Unown was a damn problem
[01:08:29] <@%VulshokSorcerer> oh hey, it's Pikalax
[01:08:31] <Chookky> is a hg/ss catch em all possible?
[01:08:34] <%+RNGHater> LUL
[01:08:35] <@%+PikalaxALT> that's a prerequisite for speedchoice completion
[01:08:37] <@%VulshokSorcerer> we should yell at him to fix headbutt
[01:08:44] <@%z_mistake> yes it would just take a long time
[01:08:54] <@%+PikalaxALT> what's the exact issue with headbutt?
[01:08:56] <+Hollow_gaze> are you talking to emerald? my internet dies
[01:08:58] <$Doughnut911> at least you guys made fixed Unknown by just making it the starter
[01:09:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> that slots suck for rando
[01:09:20] <@%+PikalaxALT> @VulshokSorcerer oh yeah, that's a given
[01:09:35] <+Hollow_gaze> catch'em all its funny to see
[01:09:50] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I still say we should put Sweet Scent on the Unown
[01:09:55] <+Hollow_gaze> but i think i would get stressed
[01:10:14] <kidumbra> it's not fixed unless you get all 28 unown to choose from Kappa
[01:10:46] <Chookky> would you consider doing a hg/ss catch em all in the near future? :D
[01:11:03] <%+RNGHater> Maybe on sellout?

[01:21:21] <%Vadalken> I can see the appeal of litteraly having steel balls.
[01:21:32] <@%VulshokSorcerer> keizathon 2: American health care still sucks ass
[01:21:34] <%Vadalken> I can also immagine the inconvenience of the waight.
[01:21:39] <@%KirbymastaH> flareon
[01:21:40] <%$RyuSerabii> @keizaron btw, apparently the upcoming NJPW G1 is being sponsored by one of my weeb rhythm games. I wish I was joking.
[01:21:56] <@%imasquirel> huh what rhythm game is sponsoring g1?
[01:21:56] <@%BotGotsThis> huh™
[01:22:05] <@%+PikalaxALT> it's fixed in the next version
[01:22:09] <%$RyuSerabii> Bang Dream! Girls Band Party
[01:22:27] <%$RyuSerabii> They posted about it on their official sites
[01:22:37] <@%imasquirel> well that doesn't surprise me since bushiroad is a sponsor of njpw
[01:22:53] <%$RyuSerabii> They basically own it
[01:22:57] <@%+PikalaxALT> it was a side effect of how i implemented flying to kanto from johto
[01:23:00] <@%imasquirel> BuddyFight has an Okada card keizaLUL
[01:23:22] <%$RyuSerabii> Which is kinda funny bc it means that all the gacha whales are basically paying wrestlers keizaLUL
[01:23:34] <%$RyuSerabii> Myself included keizaW
[01:23:39] <@%imasquirel> i used to be a gacha whale.... not anymore
[01:23:57] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I was fortunately never a gacha whale
[01:23:58] <%$tctrain> There's more? DansGame
[01:24:01] <%+kzdouglas135> But wait, there's more!
[01:24:16] <@%VulshokSorcerer> though I did nolife them as a free player for a while
[01:24:21] <%$RyuSerabii> 💵 🐋
[01:24:26] <@%imasquirel> @VulshokSorcerer I used to play brave frontier and Rage of Bahamut. so I was a gacha whale
[01:24:36] <@%imasquirel> 💵 🐋
[01:24:43] <%$RyuSerabii> It it’s like $10 or under I’ll pay for it
[01:24:44] <@%+PikalaxALT> it can bearly be contained to one place
[01:24:45] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I played Brave Frontier for a while, but never spent mondey
[01:24:45] <%tanukeki> the new zubat
[01:24:48] <@%VulshokSorcerer> *money
[01:25:09] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I also played Heroes Charge for a while, and again spent nothing
[01:25:14] <lordariados67> why is a BEAR scared in a CAVE?!
[01:25:38] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and then FEH, where I still spent no money, but was also becoming disillusioned with the concept
[01:25:44] <%+RNGHater> Anime DansGame
[01:25:44] <%$RyuSerabii> Like bang Dream will give you 80 gems a day every day for a month if you spend $10 (along with instantly giving you 1k gems and stuff to unlock new songs) so I figure why not
[01:26:03] <%$RyuSerabii> @vulshoksorcerer FEH gives you sooooo much free shit there’s 0 point in money spending tbh
[01:26:12] <@%VulshokSorcerer> true
[01:26:15] <%eskaria> Do you know the...
[01:26:15] <@%imasquirel> oh that's an easy way for them to trick you into spending money
[01:26:25] <%$tctrain> Not to mention FEH hasn't had a good banner since march Kappa
[01:26:26] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but getting the specific heroes you want for FEH is still shit
[01:26:41] <@%imasquirel> like: if u spend $10, then you get this many gems/stones/diamonds each day for a month
[01:26:42] <%$RyuSerabii> That’s why I don’t have hopes for who I summon LOL
[01:26:48] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I never did get a Lyn, and I never had a decent Axe hero
[01:26:55] <%$RyuSerabii> Which Lyn
[01:27:01] <%$RyuSerabii> Archer or Bride?
[01:27:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> any of them
[01:27:12] <%$RyuSerabii> I somehow got both
[01:27:14] <@%imasquirel> i played feh for about a month then quit
[01:27:16] <%$tctrain> I have 3 types of lyn, all of them accidentally keizaW
[01:27:23] <%$RyuSerabii> Though my pride and joy is Elincia
[01:27:25] <@%VulshokSorcerer> my best pull was a 5Star Ninian
[01:27:27] <%eulecsgo> keizaHey Keiz and Chat
[01:27:32] <@%imasquirel> I play Dokkan now but getting bored with dokkan
[01:27:36] <@%imasquirel> @eulecsgo keizaHey

[01:27:39] <%tanukeki> keizaHey @eulecsgo

[01:27:46] <%$tctrain> My sister always free summons whoever I want
[01:27:49] <%$RyuSerabii> I REMEMBER

[01:27:56] <%eulecsgo> imasquirel tanukeki keizaHey
[01:27:59] <%+RNGHater> !ninian
[01:27:59] <@%BotGotsThis> Ninian is dead.

[01:28:26] <%$RyuSerabii> I’d probably actually hate you if you prospered in Love Live or bang Dream
[01:28:28] <%eskaria> Maybe they're just pretending to be your friends keizaThink
[01:28:44] <%$RyuSerabii> Though imagining you streaming that is funny enough
[01:29:01] <%$RyuSerabii> Lemme see if I can even find the hero

[01:30:04] <@%VulshokSorcerer> we're still not sure how that worked

[01:30:38] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I can't remember if I had a chrom, haven't opened FEH in a few months
[01:30:48] <%$tctrain> I have 3 different chroms

[01:31:56] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I have deleted none of my gacha games, I just stopped opening them
[01:32:09] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so I always COULD go back, even if I probably won't
[01:32:12] <%tanukeki> i never played feh because my phone is liek 6 years old and cant run any apps anymore

[01:39:11] <$Liosiv> wait, why do you wanna fight the other twin?
[01:39:31] <+HeartlessBanana> would onix be a single stage, or can it be bred from steelix

[01:40:56] <@%z_mistake> double battles the trainers are the same
[01:41:01] <$Doughnut911> maybe those twins got rolled with the same pokemon
[01:41:03] <machtfisch> What do the red squares mean?

[02:26:15] <Mefistofelessss> holy shit man
[02:26:18] <Snowbear22> I got 99 problems and bitch ain't one lol
[02:26:20] <%XyraFhoan> I left my wallet at home and skipped lunch :(
[02:26:25] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but it was also all my food for the day, since I don't eat breakfast and skipped lunch
[02:26:55] <%+RNGHater> Neat
[02:26:55] <Mefistofelessss> That's a very healthy breakfast
[02:26:55] <@%BotGotsThis> neat™
[02:27:14] <$FactoriesFarAway> do you like chunky or smooth peanut butter
[02:27:14] <Mefistofelessss> @VulshokSorcerer and those are some very unhealthy habits
[02:27:31] <Snowbear22> Remember when nido female was only in tin tower
[02:27:42] <@%VulshokSorcerer> I'm not pretending like today was healthy for me, but it also wasn't normal
[02:28:14] <%+RNGHater> PraiseIt
[02:28:25] <Mefistofelessss> PraiseIt
[02:28:44] <%Vadalken> What is the problam with tin tower?
[02:28:49] <%+RNGHater> keizaNeat
[02:28:49] <@%BotGotsThis> keizaNeat ™
[02:29:43] <%Vadalken> But so many tasty slots.
[02:29:54] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so for instance, right now Keiz can't even do Tin Tower, since he doesn't have Entei
[02:30:06] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but even when he gets Entei, he won't
[02:30:26] <+HeartlessBanana> but what if entai is only in tin Kappa
[02:30:27] <MattMasters22> Imagine Enti is in tin tower
[02:30:38] <@%VulshokSorcerer> it can't be
[02:30:38] <%+RNGHater> Meme Tower is like... Only if there's no other place in the game.
[02:30:43] <@%VulshokSorcerer> or at least, it can't only be there
[02:30:45] <MattMasters22> damn
[02:30:46] <Mefistofelessss> oh ok
[02:30:52] <%+RNGHater> And even then, he would headbutt or check the Lugia first LUL
[02:31:11] <Mefistofelessss> He is a chaotic evil
[02:31:15] <MattMasters22> ^
[02:31:16] <@%VulshokSorcerer> we can enjoy Keiz struggling, but we still want him to win in the end
[02:31:24] <@%VulshokSorcerer> otherwise it sucks for everybody
[02:31:29] <%+RNGHater> ^
[02:31:30] <MattMasters22> thats true
[02:31:39] <%+RNGHater> We also like the keizaPride moments
[02:31:48] <%+RNGHater> Those are keizaChamp
[02:31:53] <@%VulshokSorcerer> keizaPride is the reason to never miss a CEA
[02:31:53] <%Vadalken> Oh, it also has puzzle floors.
[02:32:02] <%Vadalken> I like it.
[02:32:28] <%+RNGHater> @VulshokSorcerer This. Every damn time.
[02:32:39] <+MyNameIsNotActuallyDewey> It's like a worse version of the Lavender Tower in Gen 1
[02:32:47] <+MyNameIsNotActuallyDewey> but "worse" isn't a strong enough word
[02:33:09] <%+RNGHater> Hellish version
[02:33:09] <+Zodrow15> tin towers is just shit
[02:33:41] <+HeartlessBanana> how many slots in tin?
[02:33:47] <@%VulshokSorcerer> !251slots
[02:33:48] <@%BotGotsThis> 7 ground/3 surf per route, cannot have duplicates in the same type of slot, headbutt and fishing are dumb and not worth
[02:33:56] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so, 54?
[02:34:02] <%Vadalken> What about rando races to the top of tin tower?
[02:34:17] <@%VulshokSorcerer> or wait, 9 floors of encounters? that would be 63 slots
[02:34:22] <bradleyb10> slugma in the water? okay
[02:34:31] <@%VulshokSorcerer> oh
[02:34:35] <%+RNGHater> So 51

[03:04:06] <@%VulshokSorcerer> yep
[03:04:08] <%+RNGHater> Inb4 you find now the Gaiden episode LUL
[03:04:39] <$Doughnut911> i miss going to Sabarro here in florida.
[03:05:04] <%Vadalken> I see Keiz is aiming for the headbut trees.
[03:05:06] <@%Sly_Envy> whats the hardest area to search for pokes?
[03:05:14] <@%VulshokSorcerer> tin tower
[03:05:24] <@%z_mistake> rock smash Kappa
[03:05:29] <@%VulshokSorcerer> followed probably by meme island, if only cuz it's long
[03:05:34] <%+RNGHater> Mount Meme, Tin Tower, Meme Islands
[03:05:34] <@%Sly_Envy> nice find
[03:05:35] <@%z_mistake> is tin tower worse thn headbutt?
[03:05:42] <%$Lunatone92> What about whirl islands?
[03:05:54] <@%VulshokSorcerer> meme islands is meme islands
[03:05:54] <@%z_mistake> whirld islands have like 60 encounters
[03:06:01] <%Vadalken> Headbut is only bad because getting encounters takes a long time.
[03:06:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> *whirl for one of those
[03:06:10] <@%Sly_Envy> lol
[03:06:30] <%$Lunatone92> keizaLUL
[03:06:33] <@%z_mistake> but headbutt is also bad because some special trees have different pokes
[03:06:36] <Mysidian> still no legendary pokemon pidgey
[03:06:38] <@%Sly_Envy> whirlisland is called memeisland right vul?
[03:06:46] <%+RNGHater> yes
[03:06:52] <@%VulshokSorcerer> yes
[03:06:58] <%Vadalken> Oh, that is realy bad.
[03:07:02] <@%VulshokSorcerer> that was what I tried to say
[03:07:05] <@%Sly_Envy> wats memetower?
[03:07:08] <@%VulshokSorcerer> tin
[03:07:10] <@%z_mistake> tin tower
[03:07:14] <%+RNGHater> tin tower
[03:07:19] <@%VulshokSorcerer> mt meme is mortar, meme cave is silver
[03:07:24] <@%VulshokSorcerer> or union, but mostly silver
[03:07:33] <@%z_mistake> union is onion
[03:07:39] <@%VulshokSorcerer> right
[03:07:58] <%+RNGHater> mt meme is annoying because needs hm 07
[03:08:04] <Snowbear22> Is it a concern to not see unown on any trainer?
[03:08:06] <Mausgerecht> 5:55:55 inc
[03:08:17] <@%VulshokSorcerer> not really snowbear
[03:08:23] <%+RNGHater> The concern would be not ficning the slot
[03:08:24] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> 5:55:55
[03:08:26] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> 5 5s
[03:08:29] <@%z_mistake> unown works fine in gen 2
[03:08:32] <@%VulshokSorcerer> you can detect it when sweet scent fails
[03:08:36] <@%z_mistake> it's gen 3 where its an issue
[03:08:37] <%+RNGHater> Imagine if the unown slot wasin Tin Tower DansGame
[03:08:39] <Mefistofelessss> 5 5s hype

[04:57:27] <Snowbear22> Since you have to level is up?
[04:57:30] <Aaron0000> Somewhat certain exp for a poke is based on HP stat.
[04:57:31] <@%Sly_Envy> wats the evolution lvl range from dratini?
[04:57:34] <@%VulshokSorcerer> he has gengar info

[05:07:44] <%+thetnacrimson> is there enough steps to hatch 2 eggs in kanto?

[05:07:57] <%+thetnacrimson> uh 10.5 hrs uusually
[05:08:01] <@%VulshokSorcerer> 9-12

[05:10:18] <@%VulshokSorcerer> yep
[05:10:49] <ultrabeep> does the meme allow him to count down egg steps in kanto, even if he hatches the egg in johto?
[05:10:51] <$FreeqAxel> very nice
[05:11:02] <@%VulshokSorcerer> no, cuz he might hatch by accident
[05:11:04] <Aaron0000> Is this the Keizarap
[05:11:09] <Aaron0000> (You just do the singing)
[05:11:57] <Snowbear22> Magikarp was said to be in tower
[05:12:03] <ultrabeep> and only tower iirc
[05:12:23] <Aaron0000> Macargo would be easy to find IRL, just look for a mile-wide area of burnt EVERYTHING
[05:12:23] <@%VulshokSorcerer> keiz shiny breeding

[05:13:47] <Snowbear22> Voltorb in mount silver lol
[05:13:51] <ultrabeep> whelp
[05:13:55] <%+RNGHater> oh no, not like this
[05:13:56] <@%VulshokSorcerer> those are some big levelups
[05:13:57] <ultrabeep> magcargo is level 38
[05:14:06] <$FreeqAxel> ouch
[05:14:10] <Snowbear22> Grind mount silver
[05:14:12] <@%VulshokSorcerer> uh...
[05:14:18] <+HeartlessBanana> happy 8 hours
[05:14:26] <%+thetnacrimson> technically can't U farm the elite 4 to level up BUT not evolve them on the Elite 4?
[05:14:27] <ultrabeep> rip the PB dream
[05:14:28] <@%VulshokSorcerer> would it be worth fighting red to get EXP, then refighting E4?
[05:14:29] <$DecemberBlack> is gengar not a trade poke?
[05:14:36] <%+RNGHater> What about leveling up close to evo while doing E4? keizaThink
[05:14:48] <$FreeqAxel> not in this DecemberBlack
[05:14:51] <$DecemberBlack> kk
[05:14:51] <%+kzdouglas135> b button strats lol
[05:15:34] <ultrabeep> that's one small step for man
[05:15:37] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and we will have to breed for magikarp
[05:15:38] <Snowbear22> Time to grind mount silver
[05:15:40] <ultrabeep> one giant leap for hiker motherfuck
[05:15:42] <@%VulshokSorcerer> unless we go into tower to catch it
[05:15:46] <Aaron0000> Kanto: Where dreams go to die.
[05:16:00] <%$KatoPokeNerd95> I read that as Kato: Where dreams go to die.
[05:16:05] <%$KatoPokeNerd95> Which is also accurate keizaLUL
[05:16:05] <Snowbear22> Also need to breed for magikarp
[05:16:14] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so Johto% requires 2 breeds, and 2 bad levelings, but it's doable
[05:16:18] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so good meme everyone
[05:16:32] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> did he find something that was kanto only? or going to mt silver
[05:16:35] <@%$ProjectRevoTPP> keizaThink
[05:16:37] <ultrabeep> magcargo
[05:16:38] <$FreeqAxel> not sure yet
[05:16:43] <%+thetnacrimson> I think hes going Mt silver
[05:16:43] <@%VulshokSorcerer> Mt Silver has Voltorb and Aipom
[05:16:44] <ultrabeep> so he has to level to 38
[05:16:57] <%+RNGHater> If you don't reach the level of evo would it count though?
[05:17:10] <Snowbear22> Grinding mount silver not an option?
[05:17:16] <Aaron0000> I still want to know how the fuck Lance has three Dragonites under level 55.
[05:17:18] <ultrabeep> I think you can't use kanto for anything evo related at all
[05:17:19] <%+RNGHater> You are not evolving it on Kanto
[05:17:30] <%+RNGHater> Just leveling up on Kanto
[05:17:34] <%+RNGHater> Not exactly the same
[05:17:50] <@%VulshokSorcerer> @ultrabeep he's defining this
[05:17:54] <@%VulshokSorcerer> so it's whatever he decides
[05:17:56] <%+RNGHater> Nvm then
[05:17:57] <@%KirbymastaH> nerd
[05:17:59] <@%KirbymastaH> keizaWut
[05:18:02] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but I think we all would be fine with E4 grind
[05:18:05] <%$tctrain> Yeah, no xp in Kanto is rough for those two
[05:18:08] <%+thetnacrimson> its fine blisseys going to be the common for mount silver

[05:36:43] <+MyNameIsNotActuallyDewey> I've only played through 5 and have never seen that feature but I like it
[05:36:47] <@%z_mistake> nvm 5 had the better exp system
[05:36:51] <@%VulshokSorcerer> was such a good change when I found that out in 6
[05:36:59] <@%VulshokSorcerer> especially since I caught EVERYTHING
[05:37:02] <ultrabeep> didn't 6 undo bw experience though
[05:37:20] <+MyNameIsNotActuallyDewey> What was different about bw exp again?
[05:37:28] <ultrabeep> scales by level
[05:37:35] <ultrabeep> the higher your opponents level than yours, the more exp
[05:37:35] <%megatron990> Levelling up the high-evolve BW pokes in post-BW games is literally the worst thing ever.
[05:37:48] <+MyNameIsNotActuallyDewey> that's right

[06:13:55] <@%VulshokSorcerer> this is really going to come down to how hard it is for tech and paradox to find their whites

[06:35:19] <$brolteon> if i was a hand ass monkey i would only be in mt silver
[06:35:23] <@%VulshokSorcerer> and Paradox laughed and gave up
