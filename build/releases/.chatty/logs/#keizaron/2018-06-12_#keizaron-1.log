[23:37:55] <Eitanm> I own the senate
[23:38:28] <kidumbra> to explain further, he presumably fought the twins in Azalea. they technically have two different parties in vanilla, based on who you talk to first. in practice this just changes which of their two pokes you face first
[23:38:56] <callmeben> I didnt know the rules counted for this one too mb
[23:39:11] <@%VulshokSorcerer> rules count for pretty much everything
[23:39:13] <kidumbra> in randos, twins like can have two completely different parties as a result of how they're programmed
[23:39:32] <@%VulshokSorcerer> FM is a pseudo-exception, cuz Keiz doesn't have an issue with being informed on fusions/mechanics/etc
[23:39:38] <@%VulshokSorcerer> but even then, we shouldn't tell him how to play
[23:39:39] <kidumbra> hence my calling them quantum twinas
