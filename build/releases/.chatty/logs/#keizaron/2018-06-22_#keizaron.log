[23:02:26] <%$Red_Wavve> Go for it if you get another dragon?
[23:02:27] <%MinorInWumbology> Is penguin soldier a beast? Can you make Nekogal with it?

[23:22:48] <%MinorInWumbology> Spike seadra just irritates me since it's a sea serpent but also a dragon and I think maybe also an Aqua? What an identity crisis

[23:24:30] <%MinorInWumbology> How are you gonna get over that one?
[23:24:34] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> I'd rather that they didn't get the perfect season.
[23:24:35] <+Schaafy> is.... is that a third shield?
[23:24:49] <%+thetnacrimson> U have the best Powerback in the NFL u should run it on the first Down
[23:24:52] <SchwarzRin> campaign atec?
[23:25:12] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> If they got the perfect season then the size of Boston's ego would be so big their state wouldn't be able to contain it. It's barely keeping it at bay now
[23:25:22] <$GreenPenguinBoy> 100 years pass and me and my brother found the new avatar Manziel

[23:26:52] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> Mine has only won one since the superbowl started
[23:27:21] <%MinorInWumbology> I'm a 49rs fan a lil bit. I was dissapointed many times. They get to the late season and never win
[23:27:49] <%MinorInWumbology> Lunar Queen....Lfhgrn
[23:28:06] <%+thetnacrimson> I like how matthew stafford became a better QB after megatron retired

[23:30:32] <%$Sandpai> you said youd get him as a drop
[23:30:41] <%+thetnacrimson> I love the red wings its a dam shame that in 6 years we went from winning a title to sucking terribly
[23:30:47] <$GreenPenguinBoy> I remember when the red wings were in the west
[23:30:59] <%MinorInWumbology> Can't you also buy him after winning him tho?
[23:31:18] <%$Sandpai> mhm you can
[23:31:18] <+Schaafy> hes saying, its possible to win 3 eventually
[23:31:24] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> The Red Wings I would say are easily a dynasty. How many years was it they made it in the playoffs in a row? 25?
[23:31:25] <+Schaafy> if he decides to farm peggy
[23:31:45] UNMOD: lillymichiru
[23:32:02] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> I remember the Flyers easily being one of the best teams in teh NHL until they came up against the Red Wings and got swept
[23:32:07] <AliSnuggles> I like the blue walls
[23:32:15] <%+thetnacrimson> The Flyers had the best goalie of all tiem
[23:32:17] <%$tctrain> Are any teams in detroit good anymore? FeelsBadMan
[23:32:20] <%+thetnacrimson> Sergie Motherfuckin Bobrovsky
[23:32:23] <%+thetnacrimson> the best cop on the force
[23:32:31] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> They had a lot of good goalies....not so much anymore at the moment
[23:32:38] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> Not until Carter Hart is ready

[23:34:03] <%+skinnybeatz> ive been out of hockey for a few years now, i need to get back into i
[23:34:03] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> Or, any good goalies
[23:34:19] <@%$NlS01> I appreciate it too keizaLove
[23:34:22] <%+thetnacrimson> brng back 40 year old bobrovsky
[23:34:55] <%MinorInWumbology> Seto 2's stupid fucking shirt in that scene is the best. It looks just like the covers of those old notebooks you'd write in at school.
[23:35:42] <%+thetnacrimson> even though he was never a redwing I loved watching Wayne Gretzky was honestly my favourite player to watch
[23:35:51] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> The sign of a good dynasty is being able to stay good throughout the years without sacrificing too much cap space
[23:36:04] <%+thetnacrimson> @HerculesBenchpress did u guy even start a goalie this year in the postseason?
[23:36:27] <%MinorInWumbology> HYPE

[23:36:40] <%Don> not bad
[23:37:28] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> I am honestly annoyed with Hakstol because he never switches things up in the post season. Neuvy should have started sooner. Just like in the series against the caps a few years ago

[23:38:49] <@%$NlS01> FOOTBALL NOT SOCCER Kappa
[23:39:07] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> The flyers really fucked some things up over the years. Like trading away Forsberg and Hexy for Lindros who had a pretty short career
[23:39:12] <%+payroll_wg> as a hawks fan i thank you for letting hoss go

[23:43:14] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> Yes
[23:43:38] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> Seattle's is gonna get a professional team by like 2020 if everything goes well

[23:47:06] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> They're redoing the entire concourse and putting in a glass wall that gives a view of the Philly skyline
[23:47:21] <@%$HerculesBenchpress> Sowhile no one is using it they're gonna punch a hole in the wall
